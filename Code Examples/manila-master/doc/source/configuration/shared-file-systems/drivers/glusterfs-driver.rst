GlusterFS driver
================

GlusterFS driver uses GlusterFS, an open source distributed file system,
as the storage back end for serving file shares to the Shared File
Systems clients.

.. note::
   This driver has been deprecated in 18.0.0 release.

Supported shared filesystems and operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The driver supports NFS shares.

The following operations are supported:

-  Create a share.

-  Delete a share.

-  Allow share access.

   Note the following limitations:

   - Only IP access type is supported

   - Only read-write access is supported.

-  Deny share access.

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Install glusterfs-server package, version >= 3.5.x, on the storage
   back end.

-  Install NFS-Ganesha, version >=2.1, if using NFS-Ganesha as the NFS
   server for the GlusterFS back end.

-  Install glusterfs and glusterfs-fuse package, version >=3.5.x, on the
   Shared File Systems service host.

-  Establish network connection between the Shared File Systems service
   host and the storage back end.

Shared File Systems service driver configuration setting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following parameters in the Shared File Systems service's
configuration file ``manila.conf`` need to be set:

.. code-block:: ini

   share_driver = manila.share.drivers.glusterfs.GlusterfsShareDriver

If the back-end GlusterFS server runs on the Shared File Systems
service host machine:

.. code-block:: ini

   glusterfs_target = <glustervolserver>:/<glustervolid>

If the back-end GlusterFS server runs remotely:

.. code-block:: ini

   glusterfs_target = <username>@<glustervolserver>:/<glustervolid>

Known restrictions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  The driver does not support network segmented multi-tenancy model,
   but instead works over a flat network, where the tenants share a
   network.

-  If NFS Ganesha is the NFS server used by the GlusterFS back end, then
   the shares can be accessed by NFSv3 and v4 protocols. However, if
   Gluster NFS is used by the GlusterFS back end, then the shares can
   only be accessed by NFSv3 protocol.

-  All Shared File Systems service shares, which map to subdirectories
   within a GlusterFS volume, are currently created within a single
   GlusterFS volume of a GlusterFS storage pool.

-  The driver does not provide read-only access level for shares.
