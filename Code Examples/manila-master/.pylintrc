# can either give multiple identifiers separated by comma (,) or put this
# option multiple times (only on the command line, not in the configuration

# disable everything first and then reenable specific checks. For example, if
# you want to run only the similarities checker, you can use "--disable=all
# --enable=similarities". If you want to run only the classes checker, but have
