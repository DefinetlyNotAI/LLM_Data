# Define the minimum and maximum version of the API across all of the
# REST API. The format of the version is:
# X.Y where:
#
# - X will only be changed if a significant backwards incompatible API
# change is made which affects the API as whole. That is, something
# that is only very very rarely incremented.
#
# - Y when you make any change to the API. Note that this includes
# semantic changes which may not affect the input or output formats or
# even originate in the API code layer. We are not distinguishing
# between backwards compatible and backwards incompatible changes in
# the versioning system. It must be made clear in the documentation as
# to what is a backwards compatible change and what is a backwards
# incompatible one.

#
# You must update the API version history string below with a one or
# two line description as well as update rest_api_version_history.rst
REST_API_VERSION_HISTORY = """

    REST API Version History:

    * 1.0  - Initial version. Includes all V1 APIs and extensions in Kilo.
    * 2.0  - Versions API updated to reflect beginning of microversions epoch.
    * 2.1  - Share create() doesn't ignore availability_zone field of share.
    * 2.2  - Snapshots become optional feature.
    * 2.3  - Share instances admin API
    * 2.4  - Consistency Group support
    * 2.5  - Share Migration admin API
    * 2.6  - Return share_type UUID instead of name in Share API
    * 2.7  - Rename old extension-like API URLs to core-API-like
    * 2.8  - Attr "is_public" can be set for share using API "manage"
    * 2.9  - Add export locations API
    * 2.10 - Field 'access_rules_status' was added to shares and share
            instances.
    * 2.11 - Share Replication support
    * 2.12 - Manage/unmanage snapshot API.
    * 2.13 - Add "cephx" auth type to allow_access
    * 2.14 - 'Preferred' attribute in export location metadata
    * 2.15 - Added Share migration 'migration_cancel',
            'migration_get_progress', 'migration_complete' APIs, renamed
            'migrate_share' to 'migration_start' and added notify parameter
             to 'migration_start'.
    * 2.16 - Add user_id in share show/create/manage API.
    * 2.17 - Added project_id and user_id fields to the JSON response of
             snapshot show/create/manage API.
    * 2.18 - Add gateway to the JSON response of share network show API.
    * 2.19 - Share snapshot instances admin APIs
            (list/show/detail/reset-status).
    * 2.20 - Add MTU to the JSON response of share network show API.
    * 2.21 - Add access_key to the response of access_list API.
    * 2.22 - Updated migration_start API with 'preserve-metadata', 'writable',
            'nondisruptive' and 'new_share_network_id' parameters, renamed
            'force_host_copy' to 'force_host_assisted_migration', removed
            'notify' parameter and removed previous migrate_share API support.
            Updated reset_task_state API to accept 'None' value.
    * 2.23 - Added share_type to filter results of scheduler-stats/pools API.
    * 2.24 - Added optional create_share_from_snapshot_support extra spec,
             which was previously inferred from the 'snapshot_support' extra
             spec. Also made the 'snapshot_support' extra spec optional.
    * 2.25 - Added quota-show detail API.
    * 2.26 - Removed 'nova_net_id' parameter from share_network API.
    * 2.27 - Added share revert to snapshot API.
    * 2.28 - Added transitional states to access rules and replaced all
             transitional access_rules_status values of
             shares (share_instances) with 'syncing'. Share action API
             'access_allow' now accepts rules even when a share or any of
             its instances may have an access_rules_status set to 'error'.
    * 2.29 - Updated migration_start API adding mandatory parameter
             'preserve_snapshots' and changed 'preserve_metadata', 'writable',
             'nondisruptive' to be mandatory as well. All previous

             fields to 'share_group' object.
    * 2.35 - Added support to retrieve shares filtered by export_location_id
             and export_location_path.
    * 2.36 - Added like filter support in ``shares``, ``snapshots``,
             ``share-networks``, ``share-groups`` list APIs.

    * 2.45 - Added access metadata for share access and also introduced
             the GET /share-access-rules API. The prior API to retrieve
             access rules will not work with API version >=2.45.
    * 2.46 - Added 'is_default' field to 'share_type' and 'share_group_type'
             objects.
    * 2.47 - Export locations for non-active share replicas are no longer
             retrievable through the export locations APIs:
             GET /v2/{tenant_id}/shares/{share_id}/export_locations and
             GET /v2/{tenant_id}/shares/{share_id}/export_locations/{
             export_location_id}. A new API is introduced at this
             version: GET /v2/{tenant_id}/share-replicas/{
             replica_id}/export-locations to allow retrieving individual
             replica export locations if available.
    * 2.48 - Added support for extra-spec "availability_zones" within Share
             types along with validation in the API.
    * 2.49 - Added Manage/Unmanage Share Server APIs. Updated Manage/Unmanage
             Shares and Snapshots APIs to work in
             ``driver_handles_shares_servers`` enabled mode.
    * 2.50 - Added update share type API to Share Type APIs. Through this API
             we can update the ``name``, ``description`` and/or
             ``share_type_access:is_public`` fields of the share type.
    * 2.51 - Added Share Network with multiple Subnets. Updated Share Networks
             to handle with one or more subnets in different availability
             zones.
    * 2.52 - Added 'created_before' and 'created_since' field to list messages
             filters, support querying user messages within the specified time
             period.
    * 2.53 - Added quota control to share replicas.
    * 2.54 - Share and share instance objects include a new field called
             "progress" which indicates the completion of a share creation
             operation as a percentage.
    * 2.55 - Share groups feature is no longer considered experimental.
    * 2.56 - Share replication feature is no longer considered experimental.
    * 2.57 - Added Share server migration operations:
             'share_server_migration_check'
             'share_server_migration_cancel'
             'share_server_migration_complete'
             'share_server_migration_start'
             'share_server_migration_get_progress'
             'share_server_reset_task_state'
    * 2.58 - Added 'share_groups' and 'share_group_snapshots' to the limits
             view.
    * 2.59 - Add driver ``details`` field to migration get progress.
    * 2.60 - API URLs no longer need to include a project_id parameter.
    * 2.61 - Added optional provisioning:max_share_size and
             provisioning:min_share_size extra specs,
             which can add minimum and maximum share size restrictions
             on a per share-type granularity.
    * 2.62 - Added quota control to per share size.
    * 2.63 - Changed the existing behavior of 'add_security_service' action on
             the share network's endpoint to allow the addition of security
             services, even when the share network is in use. Also, added new
             actions on the share network's endpoint:
             'update_security_service', 'update_security_service_check' and
             'add_security_service_check'.
    * 2.64 - Added 'force' field to extend share api, which can extend share
             directly without validation through share scheduler.
    * 2.65 - Added ability to set affinity scheduler hints via the share
             create API.
    * 2.66 - Added filter search by group spec for share group type list.
    * 2.67 - Added ability to set 'only_host' scheduler hint for the share
             create and share replica create API.
    * 2.68 - Added admin only capabilities to share metadata API
    * 2.69 - Added new share action to soft delete share to recycle bin or
             restore share from recycle bin. Also, a new parameter called
             `is_soft_deleted` was added so users can filter out
             shares in the recycle bin while listing shares.
    * 2.70 - Added support for multiple share network subnets in the same
             availability zone. Also, users can add subnets for an in-use share
             network.
    * 2.71 - Added 'updated_at' field in share instance show API output.
    * 2.72 - Added new option ``share-network`` to share replica creare API.

    * 2.74 - Allow/deny share access rule even if share replicas are in
             'error' state.
    * 2.75 - Added option to specify quiesce wait time in share replica
             promote API.
