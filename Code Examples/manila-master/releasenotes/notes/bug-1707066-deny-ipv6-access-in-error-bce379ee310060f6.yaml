fixes:
  - The access-allow API accepts ipv6 rules and ignores them if the
    configured backend does not support ipv6 access rules.
    However, when the access-deny API is invoked to remove such
    rules, they used to be stuck in "denying" state. This bug has been
    fixed and ipv6 access rules can be denied successfully.
