features:
  - The scheduler was improved to select and weigh compatible back ends when
    creating shares from snapshots. This change only affects the existing
    behavior if the option ``use_scheduler_creating_share_from_snapshot`` is
    enabled.
  - A new share status `creating_from_snapshot` was added to inform the user
    that a share creation from snapshot is in progress and may take some time
    to be concluded. In order to quantify the share creation progress a new
    field called ``progress`` was added to shares and share instances information,
    to indicate the conclusion percentage of share create operation (0 to 100%).
fixes:
  - The availability zone parameter is now being considered when creating
    shares from snapshots.
