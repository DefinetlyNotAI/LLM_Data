    Fixed an issue in NetApp driver share replica periodic check that
    erroneously set a replica state to 'error'. In this routine, a SnapMirror
    resync operation was being triggered while the replica data transfering is
    still in progress, receiving an error from the storage side. The driver now
    skips resync operation for all in progress SnapMirror relationship status.
