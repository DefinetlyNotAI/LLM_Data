    Added support for FPolicy on NetApp ONTAP driver. FPolicy allows creation
    of file policies that specify file operation permissions according to
    file type. This feature can be enabled using the following extra-specs:

    - ``netapp:fpolicy_extensions_to_include``:
      specifies file extensions to be included for screening. Values should be
      provided as comma separated list.
    - ``netapp:fpolicy_extensions_to_exclude``:
      specifies file extensions to be excluded for screening. Values should be
      provided as comma separated list.
    - ``netapp:fpolicy_file_operations``:
      specifies all file operations to be monitored. Values should be provided
      as comma separated list.

    FPolicy works for backends with and without share server management. When
    using NetApp backends with SVM administrator accounts, make sure that the
    assigned access-control role has access set to "all" for "vserver fpolicy"
    directory.

    This feature does not work with share replicas to avoid failures on replica
    promotion, due to lack of FPolicy resources in the destination SVM.
