    Fixed an issue on Container driver when managing share servers. The regex
    used to search for container-name in the available network interfaces
    was updated to support newer versions of Open vSwitch. Refer to the
    `Bug #1896322 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/manila/+bug/1896322>`_ for more
    details.
