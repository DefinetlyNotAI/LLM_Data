deprecations:
  - Deprecation of the manila v1 API was announced in the mitaka release.
    The versions response from the API has been fixed to state that this
    version has been deprecated. If you are using v1 API, consider switching
    to the v2 API to take advantage of newer features. v2 API has support for
    'microversions'. Any endpoint on the v2 API can be requested with the HTTP header
    'X-OpenStack-Manila-API-Version' and providing a value '2.x', where '2' is the
    major version and 'x' is the minor (or 'micro') version. To continue exploiting
    feature functionality that was part of the v1 API, you may use the v2 API with
    the microversion '2.0', which is behaviourally identical to the v1 API.
