features:
  - Added APIs with default policy set to 'rule:default' that allow the
    creation of share networks with multiple subnets. This gives the users
    the ability to create multiple subnets in a share network for different
    availability zones. Also, users will be able to delete and show
    existing subnets.
  - Updated the share server API to make possible to manage share servers
    in a specific subnet when the driver is operating in
    ``driver_handles_share_servers`` enabled mode.
  - Share servers are now associated with a single share network subnet, which
    pertain to a share network.
upgrade:
  - On upgrading to this release, all existing share networks will be updated
    to accommodate an availability zone assignment. Existing share networks
    will have their availability zone set to "empty" indicating that they are
    available across all storage availability zones known to manila.
fixes:
  - A share network cannot be provided while creating a share replica. Replicas
    will inherit the share's share network if one exists.
