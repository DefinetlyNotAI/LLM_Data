deprecations:
  - |
    As of the Wallaby release the CephFS driver no longer recognizes
    the scoped extra-spec ``cephfs:data_isolated`` because it is no
    longer supported by the Ceph community.  This style of data isolation
    required dedicating a Ceph pool for each share and scaled and performed
    poorly.
  - |
    The ``ceph_volume_client`` is deprecated by the CephFS driver in favor of
    a python rados client that connects to the Ceph manager daemon to interact
    with the Ceph cluster.  This new connection method will enable functionality
    not available with older client, which has been deprecated by the Ceph
    community and will be removed in the Quincy release.
upgrade:
  - |
    Manila's CephFS drivers now **require** the "python3-ceph-argparse" and
    "python3-rados" packages.  Do not upgrade without adding these packages
    to the environment where the ``manila-share`` service runs since
    without them the driver will refuse to start up.  This breaking change
    is necessary because the old ``ceph_volume_client`` has been deprecated
    by the Ceph community.
features:
  - |
    The Ceph backend can now work with multiple filesystem clusters.
    The filesystem to be used by manila can be specified by the
    driver option 'cephfs_filesystem_name'. If this option is not specified,
    the driver will assume that a single filesystem is present in the Ceph
    cluster and will attempt to use it.
  - |
    Deletion of shares offerd by the CephFS driver (CephFS and NFS) is
    now faster. Now the Ceph manager moves deleted share's content to a
    trash folder and purges the contents asynchronously rather than
    handling this as part of the synchronous delete operation. The purge
    can take considerable time if a share contains a significant amount of data.
