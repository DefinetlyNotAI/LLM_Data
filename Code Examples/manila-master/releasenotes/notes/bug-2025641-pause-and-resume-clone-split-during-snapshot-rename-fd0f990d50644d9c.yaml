    In case of NetApp ONTAP driver, when snpashots are soft deleted (i.e. they
    are renamed if delete fails) sometime we face issue in during rename. This
    is due to busy snapshots. To overcome this, Manila will stop clone split,
    perform rename and start clone split again. For more details, please refer
    to `launchpad bug 2025641 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/manila/+bug/2025641>`_
