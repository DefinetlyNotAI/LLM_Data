    `Bug #1925486 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/manila/+bug/1925486>`_
    Share replica create API does not support share network option and uses
    parent share's share network. Fixed it to allow any share network by providing
    option ``share-network``. Added in API microversion starting with '2.72'.
