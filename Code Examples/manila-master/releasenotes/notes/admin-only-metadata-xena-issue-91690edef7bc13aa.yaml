    User specified scheduler hints such as "same_host" and "different_host"
    are stored as share metadata with keys such as "__affinity_same_host" and
    "__affinity_different_host" respectively. These can be manipulated or
    deleted by end users like all metadata unless prevented by RBAC policy.
    In a future release, the service will restrict the deletion or
    manipulation of these specific metadata items.
