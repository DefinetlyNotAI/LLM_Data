    NetApp ONTAP driver now supports add and update security services when
    they are associated with in use share networks. Both add and update
    operations are supported by all three security service types:
    ``active_directory``, ``kerberos`` and ``ldap``. In order to update their
    parameters in a non-disruptive way, ``active_directory`` and ``kerberos``
    don't support ``domain`` updates.
