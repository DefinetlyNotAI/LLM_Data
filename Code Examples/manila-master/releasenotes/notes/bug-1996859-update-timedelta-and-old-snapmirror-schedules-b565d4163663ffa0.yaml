fixes:
  - |
    NetApp ONTAP driver fixed to consider timestamp delta calculated from
    `netapp_snapmirror_schedule` config option instead of fixed one hour
    value. Delta is calculated as twice the time of the option. Also, ensure
    periodically that existent snapmirrors have the schedule property
    according to the `netapp_snapmirror_schedule` configuration value. For
    more details, please refer
