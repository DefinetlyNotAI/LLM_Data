features:
  - Added APIs with default policy set to
    'rule:admin_api' that allow managing and
    unmanaging share servers. Managing Share servers
    is useful for importing pre-existing shares and
    snapshots into Manila's management when the driver
    is configured in ``driver_handles_share_servers``
    enabled mode. Unmanaging removes manila share
    servers from the database without removing them
    from the back end. Managed share servers, or share
    servers that have had one or more shares unmanaged will
    not be deleted automatically when they do not have
    any shares managed by Manila, even if the config options
    [DEFAULT]/delete_share_server_with_last_share or
    [DEFAULT]/automatic_share_server_cleanup have been
    set to True.
  - Updated Manage Share API to be able to manage shares
    in ``driver_handles_share_servers`` enabled driver
    mode by supplying the Share Server ID.
  - Updated Unmanage Share and Unmanage Snapshot APIs
    to allow unmanaging shares and snapshots in
    ``driver_handles_share_servers`` enabled driver
    mode.
