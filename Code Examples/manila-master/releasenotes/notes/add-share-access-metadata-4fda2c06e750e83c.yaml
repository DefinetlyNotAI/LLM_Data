    Metadata can be added to share access rules as key=value pairs, and also
    introduced the GET /share-access-rules API with API version 2.45.
    The prior API to retrieve access rules of a given share,
    POST /shares/{share-id}/action {'access-list: null} has been
    removed in API version 2.45.
 upgrade:
  - |
    The API GET /share-access-rules?share_id={share-id} replaces
    POST /shares/{share-id}/action with body {'access_list': null} in
    API version 2.45. The new API supports access rule metadata and is expected
    to support sorting, filtering and pagination features along with newer
    fields to interact with access rules in future versions. The API request
    header 'X-OpenStack-Manila-API-Version' can be set to 2.44 to
    continue using the prior API to retrieve access rules, but no new features
    will be added to that API.
