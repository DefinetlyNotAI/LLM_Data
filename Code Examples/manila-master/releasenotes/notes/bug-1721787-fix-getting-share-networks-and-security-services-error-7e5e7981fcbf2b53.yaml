fixes:
  - Non admin users may invoke GET /share-networks and GET /security-services
    APIs with the 'all-tenants' flag in the query, however, the flag is
    ignored, and only resources belonging to the project will be served. This
    API change was made to fix bug 1721787 in the manila client project.
