    NetApp driver `bug #2059399
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/manila/+bug/2059399>`_:
    Fix the backup restore issue for NetApp driver for REST client.
    Backup restore is failing across the ONTAP cluster for REST client.
    Added the logic to use to destination vserver client for REST client
    to restore the backup and modify the restore lib for cmode REST
    client accordingly.
