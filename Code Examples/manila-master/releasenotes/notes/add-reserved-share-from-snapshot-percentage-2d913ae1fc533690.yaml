    'reserved_share_from_snapshot_percentage' backend config option allows
    Manila to consider different reservation percentage for shares that are
    being created from the snapshot.
    In case this config option is not set, the shares created from snapshot
    will use reservation percentage value set in 'reserved_share_percentage'.
    This will be useful for users who want to keep same reservation percentage
    for both non-snapshot/regular and snapshot shares.
