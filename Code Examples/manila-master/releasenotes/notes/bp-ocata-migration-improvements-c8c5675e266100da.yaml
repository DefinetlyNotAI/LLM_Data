    The share migration feature was improved to support
    migrating snapshots where possible and provide a more
    deterministic user experience.
features:
  - Added 'preserve_snapshots' parameter to share migration API.
upgrade:
  - All share migration driver-assisted API parameters are
    now mandatory.
  - Improvements to the share migration API have been qualified
    with the driver assisted migration support that exists in the
    ZFSOnLinux driver. However, this driver does not currently
    support preserving snapshots on migration.
  - Snapshot restriction in share migration API has been
    changed to return error only when parameter
    force-host-assisted-migration is True.
deprecations:
  - Support for the experimental share migration APIs has been
    dropped for API microversions prior to 2.30.
fixes:
  - Added check to validate that host assisted migration cannot
    be forced while specifying driver assisted migration options.
  - The share migration API can only be invoked when at least one
    parameter within (host, share-network, share-type) is expected
    to be changed.
