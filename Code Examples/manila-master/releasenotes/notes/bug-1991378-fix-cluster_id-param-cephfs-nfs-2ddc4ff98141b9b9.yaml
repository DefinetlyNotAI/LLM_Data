    The CephFS NFS driver, specifically the NFSProtocolHelper
    implementation, was passing a wrong param to the Ceph backend
    and this was preventing users to add and deny access to the
    created shares. With this fix, users of the CephFS NFS
    NFSProtocolHelper can normally create and remove access
    to their shares.
