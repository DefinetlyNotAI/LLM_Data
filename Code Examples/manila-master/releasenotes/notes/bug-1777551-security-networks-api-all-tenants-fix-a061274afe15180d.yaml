    The ``all_tenants`` query parameter in the share networks API (GET
    /v2/{project_id}/share-networks) has been fixed to accept 'f',
    'false', 'off', 'n', 'no', or '0'. Setting the flag to any of these values
    will retrieve security services only from the requester's project
    namespace.
