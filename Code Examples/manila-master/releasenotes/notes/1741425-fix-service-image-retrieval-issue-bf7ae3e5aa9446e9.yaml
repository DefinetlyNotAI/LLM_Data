upgrade:
  - |
    When using a driver with the ``service-instance`` module, ``manila.conf``
    now requires a ``[glance]`` section in addition the the previously required
    sections for ``[neutron]``, ``[nova]``, and ``cinder`` since the glanceclient
    is now required as well as the clients for these other services.  To generate
    a sample manila.conf that includes sections for all of these services run
    `` tox -egenconfig`` from the top of the manila source repository.
fixes:
  - |
    Share creation sometimes failed with drivers that use the
    ``service-instance`` module (currently, the ``generic`` and
    ``windows smb`` because the service-instance image could not be
    found.  The service instance module used the ``novaclient`` to
    discover the images, it paginates lists of images, and if there
    are more than 25 images the service-image may not be in the list.

    This fix switches to use the ``glanceclient`` -- a more direct and
    appropriate client for OpenStack images that is not subject to the
    pagination limitation.
