    The default check strings of all manila API RBAC policies have been
    updated to support default roles and system-scope from the OpenStack
    Identity Service (Keystone). This includes support for project member,
    project reader, project administrator user roles as well as system
    member, system reader and system administrator roles. A manila "admin"
    persona is eventually expected to transition to the system scoped
    "admin" persona and some isolated project administrator privileges (like
    force-deleting a resource, resyncing a share replica or resetting state
    of a resource) are retained to an admin user operating within the scope
    of a project. Do read further impact in the ``upgrade`` section of these
    notes.

    During the Wallaby release, API RBAC policies have new defaults, however,
    all old behavior is preserved as is, and the new defaults are not enabled.
    We encourage operators to generate the default policies via
    ``oslopolicy-sample-generator --namespace manila`` and compare them with
    any overrides you may currently have. These new default rules may
    enable you to remove matching overrides and reduce your policy
    maintenance burden. Refer to `the document on Service API protection
    <https://docs.openstack.org/keystone/latest/admin/service-api-protection.html>`_
    from the OpenStack Identity Service to understand roles, scopes,
    user personas and the motivation behind these changes. To be able to use
    systems scoped personas, you will need to enable the ``enforce_scope``
    configuration option in the ``[oslo_policy]`` section of manila.conf. To
    enforce the new defaults, the configuration option
    ``enforce_new_defaults`` must be enabled from the ``[oslo_policy]``
    section of manila.conf. We do not advise enabling the new defaults in
    production deployments yet. The manila developer community is actively
    adding test coverage and we aim to backport fixes to the Wallaby release
    and update code when we find any deficiencies. Refer to the future service
    release notes and the administrator documentation to keep abreast of the
    changes and the progress with these new defaults.
