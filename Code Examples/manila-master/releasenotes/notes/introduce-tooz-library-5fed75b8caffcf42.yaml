features:
  - Add support for the tooz library.
  - Allow configuration of file/distributed locking for the share manager
    service.
upgrade:
  - New options are necessary in manila.conf to specify the coordination
    back-end URL (for example, a Distributed Locking Manager (DLM) back-end
    or a file based lock location). The configuration determines the tooz
    driver invoked for the locking/coordination.
fixes:
  - Share replication workflows are coordinated by the share-manager service
    with the help of the tooz library instead of oslo_concurrency. This
    allows for deployers to configure Distributed Locking Management if
    multiple manila-share services are run across different nodes.
