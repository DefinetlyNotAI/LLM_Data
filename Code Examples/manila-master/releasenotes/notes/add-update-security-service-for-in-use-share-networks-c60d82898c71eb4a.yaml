features:
  - |
    Added the possibility to add and update an entire security service when
    a share network is already being used.
    A new field called ``status`` was added to the share network model and its
    default value is ``active``. Some operations might be blocked depending on
    the share network status.
    A boolean field called ``security_service_update_support`` was added to the
    share server's model. This field defaults to ``False``, and all of the
    already deployed share servers are going to get the default value even if
    their backend support it. Administrators will be able to update the field
    value using ``manila-manage`` commands.
    The scheduler will filter out backend that does not handle this request
    during some operations.
upgrade:
  - |
    ``manila-manage`` now supports share server commands, which allow
    administrators to modify the field value of some share server's
    capabilities.
