    Fixed an issue that caused Manila to return all projects' share replicas
    even when the user was not an administrator. Now, when the user is not an
    administrator, only the replicas in the project perspective are going to
    be displayed. For more details, please refer to
    `Launchpad Bug #1922243 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/manila/+bug/1922243>`_
