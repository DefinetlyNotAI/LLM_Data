features:
  - Added option "scheduler_hints" to share replica create API. For now, the
    onlyHostFilter will be supported using this option. The filter needs admin
    to specify host@backend#pool to "share_replica.scheduler_hints.only_host"
    in the request payload when creating a manila share replica. For non-admin
    users the onlyHostFilter will always be ignored.
