    New experimental APIs were introduced version ``2.47`` to retrieve
    export locations of share replicas. With API versions ``2.46`` and
    prior, export locations of non-active or secondary share replicas are
    included in the share export locations APIs, albeit these APIs do not
    provide all the necessary distinguishing information (availability zone,
    replica state and replica ID). See the `API reference
    <https://developer.openstack.org/api-ref/shared-file-system/>`_ for more
    information regarding these API changes.
deprecations:
  - |
    In API version ``2.47``, export locations APIs: ``GET
    /v2/{tenant_id}/shares/{share_id}/export_locations`` and ``GET
    /v2/{tenant_id}/shares/{share_id}/export_locations/â€‹{export_location_id
    }`` no longer provide export locations of non-active or secondary share
    replicas where available. Use the newly introduced share replica export
    locations APIs to gather this information: ``GET
    /v2/{tenant_id}/share-replicas/{share_replica_id}/export-locations`` and
    ``GET /v2/{tenant_id}/share-replicas/{share_replica_id}/export
    -locations/{export_location_id}``.
