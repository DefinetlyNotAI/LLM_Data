features:
  - Add OnlyHostFilter to manila's scheduler. This filter needs admin to
    specify host@backend#pool to "share.scheduler_hints.only_host" in the
    request payload when creating a manila share. The hint is used only
    for share creation and not stored as share metadata. For non-admin users
    the OnlyHostFilter will always be ignored.
upgrade:
  - To add OnlyHostFilter to an active deployment, its reference must be
    enabled in manila.conf.
