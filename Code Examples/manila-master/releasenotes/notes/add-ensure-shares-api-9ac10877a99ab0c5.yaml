    A new API to start the ensure shares procedure for Manila has been added.
    Through this API, OpenStack administrators will be able to recalculate the
    shares' export location without restarting the shares manager service.
    Additionally, a new configuration option named
    `update_shares_status_on_ensure` is now available to help OpenStack
    administrators determine whether the shares' status should be modified
    during the ensure shares procedure or not.
upgrade:
  - |
    When restarting the service on an upgrade, when ensure shares is being run
    it will automatically transition the shares status to `ensuring`. In case
    you would like to prevent it, please change the value of the
    `update_shares_status_on_ensure` configuration option.
