    The 'count' returned by shares and snapshots list API is fixed to provide
    correct value i.e. count of shares/snapshots instead of
    shareInstances/shareSnapshotInstances respectively. Please refer to the
    `Launchpad bug #2033604 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/manila/+bug/2033604>`_
    for more details.
