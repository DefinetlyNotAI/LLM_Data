    For some drivers, to create a share with specific protocol it is mandatory
    to add a security service to the share network beforehand. If this is
    forgotten the share ends up in error. From now on, Manila won't allow
    shares to be created when the specified protocol requires a specific
    security service type that is not associated to the share network.
