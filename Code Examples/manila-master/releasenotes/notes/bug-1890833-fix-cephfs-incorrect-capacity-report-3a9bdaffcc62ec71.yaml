    This version includes a fix to the CephFS drivers to address `an issue
    <https://launchpad.net/bugs/1890833>`_ with total and free space calculation
    in the CephFS driver. When you update, you will notice that the space
    calculations reflect reality in your Ceph clusters, and provisioning may
    fail if the share sizes exceed the cluster's free space. CephFS shares are
    always thin provisioned, and the driver does not support oversubscription
    via Manila; so space can be claimed for new shares as long as there is free
    space on the cluster. Use the "reserved_share_percentage" back end
    configuration option to ensure there's always space left aside for
    provisioned workloads to grow over time.

    The CephFS driver has now been fixed to report total and available space on
    the storage system correctly. See `Launchpad bug#1890833
    <https://launchpad.net/bugs/1890833>`_ for more details.

    The CephFS driver now honors the configuration option
    "reserved_share_percentage", and it can be used to prevent save
    space for provisioned workloads to grow over time.
