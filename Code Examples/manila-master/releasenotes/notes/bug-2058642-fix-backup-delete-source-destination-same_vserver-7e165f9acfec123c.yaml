    NetApp driver `bug #2058642
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/tempest/+bug/2058642>`_:
    Fix the backup delete issue for NetApp driver when source and destination
    vserver are same. Added the logic in resource cleanup part to delete
    the vserver peering when source and destination vserver are not same.
