fixes:
  - When upgrading manila to a new release, if a share driver has added
    support for storage pools in the new release, shares belonging to
    such drivers would be iteratively updated by manila. This is done by
    querying the back end driver for the storage pool that each share is
    hosted within. A bug affecting the database update in this path has
    been fixed.
