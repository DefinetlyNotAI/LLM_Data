issues:
  - 3parclient up to version 4.2.1 always returns only 1 VFS IP address.
    This may cause 3PAR driver boot up failure while validating VFS IP
    addresses against IP addresses configured in manila.conf.
fixes:
  - Fixed 3PAR driver boot up failure while validating share server IP address
    provided in manila.conf against IP address set on array.
