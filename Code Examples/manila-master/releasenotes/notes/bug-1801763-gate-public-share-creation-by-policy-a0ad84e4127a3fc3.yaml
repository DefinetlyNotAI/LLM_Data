features:
  - |
    New API policies (share:create_public_share and share:set_public_share)
    have been introduced for the "create" (POST /shares) and "update"
    (PUT /shares) APIs to validate requests to create publicly visible
    shares.
deprecations:
  - |
    The API policies to create publicly visible shares
    (share:create_public_share) or modify existing shares to become publicly
    visible (share:set_public_share) have their default value changed to
    rule:admin_api. This means that these APIs (POST /shares and PUT
    /shares) will allow the 'is_public' parameter to be set to True in the
    request body if the requester's role is set to an Administrator role.
    These policies will allow their previous default behavior in the Stein
    release (8.0.0) (i.e., any user can create publicly visible shares and
    even non-privileged users within a project can update their shares to
    become publicly visible). If the previous default behavior is always
    desired, deployers *must* explicitly set "share:create_public_share"
    and "share:set_public_share" to "rule:default" in their policy.json
    file.
