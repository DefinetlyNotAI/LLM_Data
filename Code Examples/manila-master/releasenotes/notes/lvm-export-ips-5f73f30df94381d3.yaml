features:
  - Added new config option 'lvm_share_export_ips' which
    allows a list of IP addresses to use for export
    locations for the LVM driver. Every share created
    will be exported on every IP address. This new option
    supercedes 'lvm_share_export_ip'.
upgrade:
  - After upgrading, rename lvm_share_export_ip to
    lvm_share_export_ips in the manila.conf file to avoid
    a deprecation warning. As long as the list remains a
    single element, functionality is unchanged.
deprecations:
  - The 'lvm_share_export_ip' option is deprecated and
    will be removed. Use 'lvm_share_export_ips' instead.
