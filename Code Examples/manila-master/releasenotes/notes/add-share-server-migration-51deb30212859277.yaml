    Added the ability to migrate share servers within and across backends in
    Manila. As designed in share migration, a two-phase approach is now
    available for share servers, with the addition of a new API to check the
    feasibility of a migration, called ``share-server-migration-check``. Now,
    Manila can start, complete, cancel and retrieve the progress of a share
    server migration. These operations were designed for Administrators and
    will work only when operating under `driver_handles_share_servers=True`
    mode. When starting a share server migration, it is possible to choose
    which capabilities must be supported by the driver: remain ``writable``
    during the first phase, ``preserve_snapshots``, be ``nondisruptive`` and
    migrate to a different share network.

    The share server entity now contains two new fields: ``task_state`` and
    `source_share_server_id`. The `task_state` field helps tracking the
    migration progress of a share server. The ``source_share_server_id`` field
    will hold the source share server identification until the migration gets
    completed or cancelled.
    New statuses were added in order to control whether a share server, its
    shares or snapshots are being migrated to a different location. Share
    server sharesâ€™ are going to remain in the status ``server_migrating`` while
    the migration is in course. When the migration gets completed, the
    statuses are going to be updated.
