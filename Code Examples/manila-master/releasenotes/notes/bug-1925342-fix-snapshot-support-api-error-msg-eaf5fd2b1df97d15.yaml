    Corrected an error message for attempts to create snapshots from shares
    that do not support this operation.  The message said that the share
    backend has no such support but that is not always true.  The original
    share for the snapshot does not support snapshots because it was created
    with a share type without the ``snapshot_support`` extra-spec set,
    irrespective of whether the back end used can itself support snapshots
    or not.
