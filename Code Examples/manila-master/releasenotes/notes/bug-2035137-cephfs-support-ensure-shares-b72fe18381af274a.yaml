fixes:
  - |
    The CephFS backend driver now supports a bulk share recovery mechanism
    (``ensure_shares``). At startup time, a combination of driver configuration
    options will determine if the driver must re-evaluate export paths of
    previously created shares. If these configuration options do not change,
    service startup will skip through this recovery stage.
  - |
    The CephFS backend driver will also reapply access rules when performing
    a recovery of pre-existing shares.
upgrade:
  - |
    A new configuration option called ``cephfs_ensure_all_shares_salt`` has
    been introduced to assist cloud administrators that would like the CephFS
    driver to reconcile export paths of existing shares during service
    startup.
