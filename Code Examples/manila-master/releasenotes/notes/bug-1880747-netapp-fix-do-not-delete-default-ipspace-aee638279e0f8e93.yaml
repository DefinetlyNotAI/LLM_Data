    NetApp ONTAP driver is now fixed to avoid the deletion of `Cluster` and
    `Default` ipspaces when deleting a share server. This issue was happening
    only when operating in `driver_handles_share_servers` enabled mode and
    creating shares using `flat` network type. See
    `Launchpad bug 1880747 <https://launchpad.net/bugs/1880747>`_ for more
    details.
