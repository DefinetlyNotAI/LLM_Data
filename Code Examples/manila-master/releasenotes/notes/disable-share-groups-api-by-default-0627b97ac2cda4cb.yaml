issues:
  - Share groups replaced the experimental consistency groups feature in Ocata.
    The APIs for share groups have a default role-based-access-control policy
    set to "!". This means that these APIs are not enabled by default on
    upgrading to the Ocata release. Modify policy.json appropriately in your
    deployment to enable these APIs. You may set these policies to
    "rule:default" to allow access to all tenants and "rule:admin_api" to
    restrict the access only to tenants with those privileges.
upgrade:
  - Policies relating to "consistency_group" and "cgsnapshot" APIs
    have been removed from manila.
    These policies can be removed from "policy.json".
