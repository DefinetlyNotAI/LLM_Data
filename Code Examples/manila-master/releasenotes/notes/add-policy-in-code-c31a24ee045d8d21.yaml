features:
  - Default Role Based Access Control (RBAC) policies for all the Manila
    APIs have moved into code from the auxiliary ``policy.json`` file.
upgrade:
  - Removed the default ``policy.json`` file.
  - Operators need not maintain the ``policy.json`` file if they were not
    overriding default manila policies.
  - If Operators need to override certain RBAC policies, they can do so by
    creating a JSON formatted file named ``policy.json`` and populate it
    with the necessary overrides. This file must be placed in the config
    directory. The default RBAC policies are documented in the configuration
    reference alongside other sample configuration files.
