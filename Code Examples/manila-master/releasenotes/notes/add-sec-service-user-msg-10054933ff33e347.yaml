    `Bug #1900755 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/manila/+bug/1900755>`_:
    Added a driver-agnostic exception to handle insufficient privileges on a
    security service when trying to create a share.
    Added a user message to provide useful information to end users.
    Note that vendors will need to implement the exception provided in this
    patch in their drivers to take advantage of the more convenient user
    message.
