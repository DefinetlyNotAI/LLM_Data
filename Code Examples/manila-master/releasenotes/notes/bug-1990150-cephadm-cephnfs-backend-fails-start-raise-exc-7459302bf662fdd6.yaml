    When deploying Manila CephFS NFS with cephadm, the manila share
    service fails to start with the error "Backend cephfsnfs supports
    neither IPv4 nor IPv6". This happens because the NFS Ganesha
    daemon fails to start for some reason, and therefore the driver
    never gets the location of the NFS Ganesha service that will be
    used as the backend. We rely on the operator to make sure the CephFS
    NFS cluster is available when initializing the driver. With this fix in
    place, we raise an exception to explicitly notify the operator and
    allow them to take further action.
