    Fixed an issue while bringing shares under Manila management. Now, when
    a share is being managed and there is no available quota to complete
    this operation, the service will allow the quotas to be exceeded and the
    operation will be completed. The administrator will need to adjust the
    quotas after. Please see
    `Launchpad bug <https://bugs.launchpad.net/manila/+bug/1863298>`_ for
    more details.
