    Fixed `launchpad bug #1885956 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/manila/+bug/1885956>`_
    by ensuring that policy checks are enforced when looking up a share-type
    by name.  This prevents a problem where shares could be stuck in CREATING
    status when a user attempts to create a share using the name of a private
    share-type to which the user lacks access.
