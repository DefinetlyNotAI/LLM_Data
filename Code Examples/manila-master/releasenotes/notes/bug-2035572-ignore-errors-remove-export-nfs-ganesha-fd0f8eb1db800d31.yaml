    The CephFS driver uses a `RemoveExport` DBUS API call to the NFS/Ganesha
    service when a user deletes an access rule, or when deleting the share.
    If this call fails, the driver now provides a log of the failure, and
    continues cleaning up.  Prior to this change, share deletion could fail if
    the service failed the DBUS command to drop the export. This would leave
    the share with an "error_deleting" status, needing administrator
    intervention. See `bug #2035572 <https://launchpad.net/bugs/2035572>`_
    for more information.
