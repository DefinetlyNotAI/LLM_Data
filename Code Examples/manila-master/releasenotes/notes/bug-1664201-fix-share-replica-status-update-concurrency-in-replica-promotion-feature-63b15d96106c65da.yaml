fixes:
  - Fixed share replica status update concurrency in share replica promotion
    feature. Before it was possible to see two active replicas,
    having 'dr' or 'readable' type of replication,
    performing 'share replica promotion' action.
    Now, replica that becomes active is always updated last, so, at some period
    of time we will have zero 'active' replicas at once instead of
    two of them.
