upgrade:
    In this release, the operation create share from snapshot was improved
    in the ZFSonLinux driver. Now, the operator using the ZFSonLinux driver
    can create a share from snapshot in different pools or backends by
    specifying the Manila API configuration option
    [DEFAULT]/use_scheduler_creating_share_from_snapshot.
