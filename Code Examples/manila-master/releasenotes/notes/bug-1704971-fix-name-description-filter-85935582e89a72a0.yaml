fixes:
  - Fix the ``exact`` filters (name, description) in ``shares``,
    ``snapshots``, ``share-networks`` list can be filter by ``inexact``
    value.
    We got the error because the ``description`` filter will be
    skipped in ``shares``, ``snapshots`` list API, and we will directly
    remove the ``inexact`` filter flag('~') and process the
    ``exact`` filters (name, description) by ``inexact`` filter logic.
    Now, we added ``description`` filter in ``shares``, ``snapshots`` list,
    and check whether the filter keys has the '~' in the end in ``shares``,
    ``snapshots``, ``share-networks`` list firstly.
