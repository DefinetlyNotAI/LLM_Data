    Manila v2 API URLs no longer require a project_id to be specified.
features:
  - |
    It is now possible to omit the %{project_id}s from the API endpoints for
    the v2 API. While the behavior of the APIs have not been altered, the
    service recognizes URLs with and without project ids in the path. It is
    recommended that you adjust the service catalog in your cloud to remove
    the project_id substitution, especially if you would like to enable
    users operating at system scope.
  - |
    A new "noauth" auth strategy is available, and is named "noauthv2".
    It can be enabled by setting the configuration option
    ``[DEFAULT]/auth_strategy`` to ``noauthv2``. This auth strategy can be
    used when project_id substitution is removed from the manila endpoint URL.
upgrade:
  - |
    In order to make project_id optional in urls, the possible values of
    project_id had to be constrained. A new configuration option called
    ``project_id_regex`` has been added in the ``[DEFAULT]`` section. The
    default value for this option is ``[0-9a-f\-]+`` and it matches hex
    UUIDs with and without dashes, therefore covering the formats supported
    by the OpenStack Identity service. If your cloud uses other formats, set
    this configuration option accordingly, or remove project_id from the
    manila endpoint URL in your service catalog.
