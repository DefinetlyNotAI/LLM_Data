    A new common user-visible share types extra-spec called
    "availability_zones" has been introduced. When using API version 2.48,
    user requests to create new shares in a specific availability zone will
    be validated against the configured availability zones of the share type.
    Similarly, users requests to create share groups and share replicas are
    validated against the share type ``availability_zones`` extra-spec when
    present. Users can also filter share types by one or more AZs that are
    supported by them.
