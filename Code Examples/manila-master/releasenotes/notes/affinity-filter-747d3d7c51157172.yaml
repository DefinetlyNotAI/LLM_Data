features:
  - Add AffinityFilter and AntiAffinityFilter to manila's scheduler.
    These hard affinity and anti-affinity filter needs user to specify
    affinity/anti-affinity share ids to the field
    "share.scheduler_hints.same_host" or
    "share.scheduler_hints.different_host" in the request payload when
    creating a manila share. The hints are stored as share metadata. The
    filter properties are populated from this metadata during share
    migration and so filters will be applied when migrating a manila share.
upgrade:
  - To add AffinityFilter and AntiAffinityFilter to an active deployment,
    their references must be added to the manila.scheduler.filters section in
    setup.cfg and must be enabled in manila.conf.
