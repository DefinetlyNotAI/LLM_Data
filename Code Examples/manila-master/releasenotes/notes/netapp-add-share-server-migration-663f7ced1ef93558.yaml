    The NetApp ONTAP driver now supports migration of share servers across
    clusters. While migrating a share server, the source remains writable
    during the first phase of the migration, until the cutover is issued. It is
    possible to specify a new share network for the destination share server,
    only if the associated security services remain unchanged.
    Share server migration relies on ONTAP features available only in versions
    equal and greater than ``9.4``. In order to have share server migration
    working across ONTAP clusters, they must be peered in advance.
    In order to adapt to different workloads and provide more flexibility on
    managing clusterâ€™s free space a new configuration option was added:

    - ``netapp_server_migration_check_capacity``:
      Specifies if a capacity validation at the destination backend must be
      made before proceeding with the share server migration. When enabled,
      the NetApp driver will validate if the destination pools can hold all
      shares and snapshots belonging to the source share server.
