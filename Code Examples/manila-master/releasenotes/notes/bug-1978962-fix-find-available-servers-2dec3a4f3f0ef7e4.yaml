    Drivers using DHSS True mode has the server creation phase. This phase
    tries to reuse one of available share servers, however, the Manila code
    is considering all share servers states as available, rather than
    considering only the active or creating ones. Now, only the correct share
    servers are passed to drivers as available to be reused.
