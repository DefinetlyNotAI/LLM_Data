    Share server deletion happens asynchronously and failure during this delete
    results in leakage of neutron ports. This is fixed in two steps, first by
    trying to delete ports before share server deletion. Second, after ports
    from Manila db entries are deleted, query is made to neutron to get ports
    which are allocated for share server and missing in db. And then try to
    delete those ports. For more details please check
