    NetApp driver: introduced the option to request ONTAP operations through
    REST API when using ONTAP 9.12.1 or greater. The new option
    `netapp_use_legacy_client` allows switching between the old ZAPI client
    approach and new REST client. It is default to `True`, meaning that the
    drivers will keep working as before using ZAPI operations. If desired, this
    option can be set to `False` connecting with new REST client that performs
    REST API operations if it is available, otherwise falls back to ZAPI.

    Also, an option called `netapp_rest_operation_timeout` was added to allow
    the user to set the maximum amount of time expected to get an output from
    a synchronous operation when using REST API. By default, the timeout value
    is 60 seconds.
