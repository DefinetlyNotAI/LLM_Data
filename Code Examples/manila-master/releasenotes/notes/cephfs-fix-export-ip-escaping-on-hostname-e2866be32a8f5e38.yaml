    When ``cephfs_ganesha_server_ip`` is not set, the current hostname is used
    as a default for such config option. The driver was treating this value
    as an IP address and trying to perform validations on it. The CEPH NFS
    driver will no longer treat hostnames as ip addresses and try to validate
    them as such.
