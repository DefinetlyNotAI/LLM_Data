    Fixed the driver filter to not check for hard equality between the
    share_backend_name and the name reported by the host as it defeats the
    purpose of the capabilities filter giving the ability to use "<in>"
    selection operator in the extra-spec. Refer to `Launchpad bug 1815700
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/manila/+bug/1815700>`_ for more details.
