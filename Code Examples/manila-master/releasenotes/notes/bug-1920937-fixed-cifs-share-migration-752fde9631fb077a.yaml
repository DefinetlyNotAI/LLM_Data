    Fixed non-disruptive share migration of CIFS shares in the NetApp ONTAP
    driver using ZAPI API. During the CIFS share migration the creation of a
    new export path is skipped and the actual export path is taken from the
    backend. For more details, please refer to
    `launchpad bug #1920937 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/manila/+bug/1920937>`_.
