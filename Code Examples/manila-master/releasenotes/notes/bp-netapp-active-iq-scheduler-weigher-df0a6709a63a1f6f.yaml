    Added the ``NetAppAIQWeigher`` scheduler weigher that relies on the
    `NetApp Active IQ <https://www.netapp.com/services/support/active-iq/>`_
    to weigh the hosts. It only works with NetApp backends. When other
    backends exist, the weigher is skipped. Added a new NetApp specific
    pool information called ``netapp_cluster_name`` that contains the name
    of the cluster where the pool is located, it can be set by a new
    NetApp configuration option.
