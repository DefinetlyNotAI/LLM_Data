critical:
  - The "host" field is no longer returned in the JSON response of the /shares
    and /share-replicas APIs when these APIs are invoked with non-admin
    privileges. Applications that depend on this field must be updated as
    necessary. The value of this field is privileged information and the
    request context must specify administrator privileges when using these
    APIs for the "host" field to be present. The use of "host" as a filter
    key in the GET /shares API is controlled with the policy "list_by_host".
    This policy defaults to "rule:admin_api".
