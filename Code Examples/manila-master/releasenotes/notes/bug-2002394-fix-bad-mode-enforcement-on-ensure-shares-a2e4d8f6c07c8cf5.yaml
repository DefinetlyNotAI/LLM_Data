    Fixed an issue that made the CephFS driver to override the permissions in
    a share. After `a bugfix <https://tracker.ceph.com/issues/54375>`_, Ceph's
    idempotent creation of shares had a change on its behavior. If a share
    mode was modified outside of Manila, or the configuration value for
    `cephfs_volume_mode` was changed in Manila when shares had already been
    created, these shares would have their mode changed while Manila attempted
    to ensure that such share exists using the idempotent creation, potentially
    breaking clients. The CephFS driver will no longer send create calls to the
    backend when ensuring a share exists. For more details, please refer to
    `Bug #2002394 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/manila/+bug/2002394>`_
