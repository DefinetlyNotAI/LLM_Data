    NFSClusterProtocolHelper has been added to allow users to consume to export CephFS shares
    over a clustered NFS gateway. This presents many advantages, since the operator no longer
    needs to maintain their own instances of NFS Ganesha apart of the Ceph cluster.
    For this, we now communicate with ceph mgr using the nfs plugin. Read more
    about this plugin in https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/cephfs/nfs/
upgrade:
  - |
    The CephFS driver now supports a new configuration option:
    * cephfs_nfs_cluster_id (string option): name of the nfs cluster to use.
    This option can be used to specify which NFS cluster to use.

    Since the CephFS driver is now capable of using ceph manager commands to manage
    NFS exports, we would like to deprecate and remove support for managing exports
    with the help of DBUS in a future release. Please use cephadm deployed NFS ganesha
    clusters in greenfield deployments with OpenStack Manila and refrain from using
    a standalone non-clustered nfs-ganesha service with this driver. As this solution
    is hardened for HA within Ceph, we expect to provide code to help migrate existing
    nfs-ganesha exports to the nfs-ganesha clusters in a future release.
