    NetApp driver now considers ``last-transfer-size`` and
    ``last-transfer-error`` fields of the snapmirror in addition to existing
    ``last-transfer-end-timestamp`` to decide whether replica is in_sync or
    out_of_sync. Added new config option
    `netapp_snapmirror_last_transfer_size_limit` (default 1MB). If value of
    `last-transfer-size` field is greater than config value or if
    `last-transfer-error` field is present, then replica is out_of_sync.
