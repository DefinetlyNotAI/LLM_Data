    The ability to create a public share (RBAC: "share:create_public_share")
    and to update a share to become publicly visible
    (RBAC: "share:set_public_share") are now restricted to administator
    users operating at system scope. Adjust your policy file overrides if
    you would like to retain the older behavior of allowing all users to
    create public shares or to update private ones to public. If you do
    that, be sure that your users are aware of the security implications of
    publicly accessible shares.
