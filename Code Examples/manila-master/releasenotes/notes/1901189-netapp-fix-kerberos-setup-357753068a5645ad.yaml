    NetApp ONTAP driver is now fixed to properly configure and clean up share
    servers with Kerberos security service, for clustered ONTAP 8.3 or higher.
    Access rules are now configured with the correct NFS authentication methods
    based on the security service configured in the share server. Please refer to
    `Launchpad Bug #1901189 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/manila/+bug/1901189>`_,
