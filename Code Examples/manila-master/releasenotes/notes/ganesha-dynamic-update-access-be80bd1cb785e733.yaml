features:
  - The new class `ganesha.GaneshaNASHelper2` in the ganesha library uses
    dynamic update of export feature of NFS-Ganesha versions v2.4 or newer
    to modify access rules of a share in a clean way. It modifies exports
    created per share rather than per share access rule (as with
    `ganesha.GaneshaNASHelper`) that introduced limitations and unintuitive
    end user experience.
