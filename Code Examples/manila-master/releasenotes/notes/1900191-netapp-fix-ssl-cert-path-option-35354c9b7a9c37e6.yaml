upgrade:
  - Added a new config option `netapp_ssl_cert_path` for NetApp driver.
    This option enables the user to choose the directory with certificates of
    trusted CA or the CA bundle. If set to a directory, it must have been
    processed using the c_rehash utility supplied with OpenSSL. If not
    informed, it will use the Mozilla's carefully curated collection of Root
    Certificates for validating the trustworthiness of SSL certificates.

    Fixed an issue on ONTAP NetApp driver that was forcing the location of
    CA certificates for SSL verification during HTTPS requests. It adds the
    `netapp_ssl_cert_path` configuration, enabling the user to choose the
    directory with certificates of trusted CA or the CA bundle. If set to a
    directory, it must have been processed using the c_rehash utility supplied
    with OpenSSL. If not informed, it will use the Mozilla's carefully curated
    collection of Root Certificates for validating the trustworthiness of SSL
    certificates. Please refer to the
    `Launchpad bug #1900191 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/manila/+bug/1900191>`_
    for more details.
