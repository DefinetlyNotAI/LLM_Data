    Add support for multiple subnet per availability zone. The multiple
    configuration can be done either on share server deployment or updating
    a pre-existent share server.

    The new field ``network_allocation_update_support`` was added to share
    server's model This field defaults to ``False``, and all of the
    already deployed share servers are going to get the default value even if
    their backend support it. Administrators will be able to update the field
    value using ``manila-manage`` commands.

    The driver will report its support for adding a subnet on a pre-existent
    share server through ``network_allocation_update_support``. Also, it will
    report the support for creating the server with multiple subnets with the
    ``share_server_multiple_subnet_support``. The scheduler will filter out
    backend that does not handle this request during some operations. Example,
    creating a share with a share network containing multiple subnets, only
    hosts that support this deployment will be selected.
deprecations:
  - |
    Remove 'share_network_subnet_id' attribute from share server view and
    add 'share_network_subnet_ids' starting with microversion '2.70'. The share
    server has a list of subnets.
