    Share group APIs have graduated from their `experimental feature state
    <https://docs.openstack.org/manila/latest/contributor/experimental_apis.html>`_
    from API version ``2.55``. Share group types can be created to encompass
    one or more share types, share groups can be created, updated, snapshotted
    and deleted, and shares can be created within share groups. These actions
    no longer require the inclusion of ``X-OpenStack-Manila-API-Experimental``
    header in the API requests.
