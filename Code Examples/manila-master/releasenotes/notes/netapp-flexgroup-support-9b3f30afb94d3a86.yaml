    The NetApp driver has been working  with FlexVol ONTAP volumes.
    The driver does not support scaling FlexVol volumes higher than
    100 TiB, which was a theoretical limit for the large namespace that
    these containers were meant to handle. ONTAP's Flexgroup volumes
    eliminate such limitations. So, added the support for provisioning
    share as FlexGroup in the NetApp driver.

    The FlexGroup provision is enabled by new option
    ``netapp_enable_flexgroup``, which will make the driver report a single
    pool represeting all aggregates. The selection on which aggregates the
    FlexGroup share will reside is up to ONTAP. If the administrator desires
    to control that selection through Manila scheduler, the configuration
    option ``netapp_flexgroup_pools`` can be used to tune the storage pool
    layout.

    When enabling FlexGroup, the FlexVol pools continue enabled by default.
    For having only FlexGroup, the new option ``netapp_flexgroup_pool_only``
    must be set to `True`.

    Now, each NetApp pool will report the capability: `netapp_flexgroup` informing
    which type of share resides there (FlexGroup or FlexVol).

    The following operations are allowed with FlexGroup shares (DHSS
    True/False and NFS/CIFS):

    - Create/Delete share;
    - Shrink/Extend share;
    - Create/Delete snapshot;
    - Revert to snapshot;
    - Manage/Unmanage snapshots;
    - Create from snapshot;
    - Replication;
    - Manage/Unmanage shares;

    FlexGroup feature requires ONTAP version 9.8 or newer.
    Replication with more than one non-active replica per share requires
    ONTAP 9.9.1 or newer.
