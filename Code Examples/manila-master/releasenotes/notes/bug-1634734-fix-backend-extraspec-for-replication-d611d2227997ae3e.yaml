    Share type extra-specification ``share_backend_name`` is now ignored when
    creating share replicas. This ensures that backends in the same
    replication domain need not have the same value of ``share_backend_name``.
    See `launchpad bug #1634734 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/manila/+bug/1634734>`_
    for details.
