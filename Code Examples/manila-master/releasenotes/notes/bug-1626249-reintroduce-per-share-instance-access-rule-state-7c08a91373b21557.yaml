features:
  - New micro-states ('applying', 'denying'), appear in the 'state' field
    of access rules list API. These transitional states signify the state of
    an access rule while its application or denial is being processed
    asynchronously.
  - Access rules can be added regardless of the 'access_rules_status'
    of the share or any of its replicas.
fixes:
  - Fixed a bug with the share manager losing access rule updates when
    multiple access rules are added to a given share simultaneously.
  - Instead of all existing access rules transitioning to 'error' state
    when some error occurs while applying or denying access rules to a given
    share, only the rules that were in transitional statuses ('applying',
    'denying') during an update will transition to 'error' state. This
    change is expected to aid in identifying any 'bad' rules that require a
    resolution by the user.
  - Share action APIs dealing with allowing and denying access to shares now
    perform the policy check for authorization to invoke those APIs as a
    preliminary step.
  - As before, when a share is replicated (or being migrated), all replicas
    (or migration instances) of the share must be in a valid state in order
    to allow or deny access to the share (where such actions are otherwise
    allowed). The check enforcing this in the API is fixed.
