    Share server backend details set function adds db records without
    checking existing entries. This results in duplicate records for the
    combination of given share server id and key. Fixed it by updating records
    if already exist else creating new. See the `launchpad bug 2024658
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/manila/+bug/2024658>`_ for more details.
