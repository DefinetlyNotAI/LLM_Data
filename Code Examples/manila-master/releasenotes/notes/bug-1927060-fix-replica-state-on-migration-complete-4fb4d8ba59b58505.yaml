    Fixed an issue that made migrated shares with replication support to do
    not have a share instance with its `replica_state` set to active. Now,
    when the share supports replication, the destination share instance will
    have its replica state set as active right after the migration gets
    completed. For more details, please refer to
    `bug 1927060 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/manila/+bug/1927060>`_
