    Role based access control is enforced on the POST /shares/{share_id}/action
    API to reset status, task state, replica state and similar fields. This
    prevents the situation where deployments allow some users access to
    these APIs, but they don't belong to projects where the resources exist.
    See `bug 1955627 <https://launchpad.net/bugs/1955627>`_ for more context.
