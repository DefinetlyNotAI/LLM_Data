    A "no-op" interface driver (manila.network.linux.interface.NoopInterfaceDriver)
    has been introduced to work with drivers that create and manage
    lifecycle of share servers (``driver_handles_share_servers=True``)
    through service instance virtual machines using OpenStack Compute. This
    interface driver can be used when manila-share is running on a machine
    that has access to the administrator network used by Manila.
