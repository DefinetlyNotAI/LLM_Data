    Fixed quota issue that made it impossible to create resources when the project had the quotas
    set to unlimited, and the user had a limited amount of quotas to use. Now, operations in the
    mentioned quota scenario are working properly. Please see `Launchpad bug 1872872
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/manila/+bug/1872872>`_ for more details.
