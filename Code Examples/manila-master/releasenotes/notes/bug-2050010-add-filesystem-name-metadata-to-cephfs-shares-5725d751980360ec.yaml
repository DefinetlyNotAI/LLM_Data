    Shares created using the CEPHFS Native protocol will now have a new
    `__mount_options` metadata containing the `cephfs_filesystem_name` to
    enhance usability while mounting shares. Existing shares will be updated
    through the ensure shares workflow. To preserve backwards compatibility,
    this metadata is mutable by end users. It is strongly recommended that
    administrators include "__mount_options" in the
    `[DEFAULT]/admin_only_metadata_keys` configuration option.
