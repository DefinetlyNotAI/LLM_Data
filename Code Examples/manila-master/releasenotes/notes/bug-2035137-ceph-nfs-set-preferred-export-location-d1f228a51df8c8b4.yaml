    It is now possible to configure `cephfs_ganesha_export_ips` (or
    alternatively, `cephfs_ganesha_server_ip`) alongside
    `cephfs_nfs_cluster_id`. Setting these options will allow the CephFS driver
    to report additional export paths. These additional export paths will have
    the "preferred" metadata key set to False. The export paths pertaining to
    the NFS service host discovered by the driver will have the "preferred"
    metadata key set to True. It is expected that administrators will configure
    additional IP addresses when preparing to migrate from a standalone
    NFS-Ganesha service to a NFS service cluster setup facilitated by the Ceph
    orchestration service. Eventually, when the migration has completed, these
    configuration options can be removed and the corresponding share export
    path records will be dropped from Manila. Note that the CephFS driver will
    not create or manipulate access rules within the NFS service configured via
    `cephfs_ganesha_export_ips` or `cephfs_ganesha_server_ip`.

    In order to assist the user experience when migrating from a standalone
    CephFS NFS (NFS-Ganesha) service to an NFS service created with the
    Ceph Orchestrator, the CephFS driver allows configuring
    `cephfs_ganesha_export_ips` (or alternatively, `cephfs_ganesha_server_ip`)
    alongside `cephfs_nfs_cluster_id`.
