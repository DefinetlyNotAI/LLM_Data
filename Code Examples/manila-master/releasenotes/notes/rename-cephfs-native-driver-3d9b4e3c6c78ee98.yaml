upgrade:
  - To use the CephFS driver, which enables CephFS access via the native Ceph
    protocol, set the `share_driver` in the driver section of the config file
    as `manila.share.drivers.cephfs.driver.CephFSDriver`. The previous
    `share_driver` setting in Mitaka/Newton/Ocata releases
    `manila.share.drivers.cephfs.cephfs_native.CephFSNativeDriver` would still
    work (usually until one more release, Queens, as part of standard deprecation
    process.), but it's usage is no longer preferred.
