deprecations:
  - |
    The configuration option ``share_usage_audit_period`` from the
    [DEFAULT] section has been deprecated. Specifying this option
    never had any effect on manila and so it will be removed in an
    upcoming release. This option should not be confused
    with ``share_usage_size_update_interval`` from the back end
    section, which can be used to gather usage size for some back ends
    that support that feature.
