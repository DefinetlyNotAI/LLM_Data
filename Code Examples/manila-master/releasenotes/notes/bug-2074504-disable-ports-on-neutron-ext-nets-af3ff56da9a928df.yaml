    When using Neutron networks tagged as `external` (unmanaged
    provider networks) as share networks, Manila now creates ports
    with `admin_state_up=False` (disabled). This change addresses
    ARP failures that can occur when using OVN as the Neutron ML2
    plugin. For more information, refer to `bug 2074504
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/manila/+bug/2074504>`_.
