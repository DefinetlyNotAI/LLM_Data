    NetApp driver `bug #2069125
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/manila/+bug/2069125>`_:
    Fixed the issue for the NetApp ONTAP driver in the ZAPI workflow,
    where certain vserver accounts failed to add access rules for a share
    when the vserver network interface was not configured with kerberos.
