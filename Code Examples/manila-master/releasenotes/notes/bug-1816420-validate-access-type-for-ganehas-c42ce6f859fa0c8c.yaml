    Access rule type for shares served via nfs-ganesha is now validated,
    fixing `launchpad bug #1816420 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/manila/+bug/1811680>`_
    where ``cephx`` access type was allowed though only ``ip`` access type
    is effective.  This fix also validates ``access_level`` to ensure that
    it is set to ``RW`` or ``RO``.
