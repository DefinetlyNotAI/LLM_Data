    It is now possible to specify pre-created NetApp efficiency
    policies through the use of the `netapp:efficiency_policy` share type
    extra spec.
    In the case of DHSS=True, the share server is not available upfront for
    efficiency policy creation. Users can retype to apply the policy, or if the
    share-network is constant (i.e., one share service is created for one share
    network), they can create an efficiency policy for the share server and
    apply it to DHSS=True shares.
