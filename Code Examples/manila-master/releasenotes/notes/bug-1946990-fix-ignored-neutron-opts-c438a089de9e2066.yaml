deprecations:
  - |
    The ``[neutron] url_timeout`` option and the ``[neutron] auth_strategy``
    option have been deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
    These two options have had no effect since 2.0.0 .

fixes:
  - |
    `Bug #1946990 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/manila/+bug/1946990>`_: Fix
    the ignored ``[neutron] url`` option. Now the parameter overrides
    the endpoint url which Manila uses to access Neutron API.
