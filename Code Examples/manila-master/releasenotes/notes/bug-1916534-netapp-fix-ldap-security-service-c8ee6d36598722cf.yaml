    NetApp ONTAP driver is now fixed to properly configure SVM LDAP client when
    configuration is provided through `ldap` security service. Now, the driver
    chooses the correct LDAP schema based on the given security service
    parameters. The `RFC-2307` schema will be set for Linux/Unix LDAP servers
    and `RFC-2307bis` for Active Directory servers. When using a Linux/Unix
    LDAP server, the security service should be configured setting the
    `server` parameter with servers IPs or host names. For Active
    Directory LDAP server, the domain information must be configured using the
    the `domain` parameter. Users should provide at least one DNS server when
    configuring servers by its host or domain names. The base search
    `distinguished name` used for LDAP queries can now be configured using
    security service `ou` parameter. Please refer to
    `Launchpad Bug #1916534 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/manila/+bug/1916534>`_
    for more details.
