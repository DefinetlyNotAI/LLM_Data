    NetApp ONTAP driver will now retry the sis operation (e.g. dedupe) if sis
    operation is currently active. This is needed because NetApp turns on
    efficiency (by default) on latest hardware which causes conflicting sis
    operation when Manila tries to turn it off. For more details, please check
    Launchpad `bug #2071359 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/manila/+bug/2071359>`_
