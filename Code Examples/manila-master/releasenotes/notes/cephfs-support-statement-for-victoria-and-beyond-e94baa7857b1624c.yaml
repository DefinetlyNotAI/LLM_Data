    This version of OpenStack Manila has not been tested with Ceph clusters
    prior to Nautilus. CephFS drivers interact with Ceph clusters
    via a python binding called "ceph_volume_client". This is being
    replaced by supplying management operations via the ceph manager
    interface that was introduced in the Nautilus release of Ceph. So it is
    advised that you upgrade your Ceph deployment prior to upgrading to
    Manila's Victoria release.
