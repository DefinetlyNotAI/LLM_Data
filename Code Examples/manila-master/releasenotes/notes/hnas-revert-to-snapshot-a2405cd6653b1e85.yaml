features:
  - Added Revert-to-snapshot functionality to Hitachi NAS driver.
upgrades:
  - If using existing share types with the HNAS back end,
    set the 'revert_to_snapshot_support' extra-spec to allow
    creating shares that support in-place revert-to-snapshot
    functionality. This modification will not affect existing
    shares of such types.
