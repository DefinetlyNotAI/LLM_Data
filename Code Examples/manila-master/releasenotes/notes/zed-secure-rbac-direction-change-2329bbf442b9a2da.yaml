    RBAC defaults of all Shared File System service (manila) APIs have been
    updated to remove "system" scope personas. This is being done in concert
    with other OpenStack services, and in reaction to operator feedback that
    the use of system "scope" introduces backwards incompatibility in existing
    workflows. The new defaults support the use of "scope", however, no RBAC
    rule by default includes "system" scope. At this time, we do not recommend
    the use of system scoped personas to interact with the Shared File
    Systems service (manila) APIs since it is largely un-tested. "reader"
    role from the OpenStack Identity service (keystone) is fully supported
    with this release. Currently, these new "defaults" are available as
    "opt-in" only to prevent breaking existing deployments. To enforce default
    RBAC rules, set ``[oslo_policy]/enforce_new_defaults`` to True in your
    deployment. This option will be set to True by default in a future
    release. See `the OpenStack TC Secure RBAC goal <https://governance.openstack
    .org/tc/goals/selected/consistent-and-secure-rbac.html>`_ for more
    information regarding these changes.
