features:
  - The NetApp driver now supports Quality of Service extra specs. To create
    a share on ONTAP with qos support, set the 'qos' extra-spec in your
    share type to True and use one of 'netapp:maxiops' and 'netapp:maxbps'
    scoped extra-specs to set absolute limits. To set size based limits,
    use scoped extra-specs 'netapp:maxiopspergib' or 'netapp:maxbpspergib'.
    QoS policies on the back end are created exclusive to each manila share.
upgrade:
  - A new configuration option 'netapp_qos_policy_group_name_template' has
    been added to allow overriding the naming of QoS policies created by the
    NetApp driver.
