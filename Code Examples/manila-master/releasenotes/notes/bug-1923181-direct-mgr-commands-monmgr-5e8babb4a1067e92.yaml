fixes:
  - |
    mgr-commands are now directed to the mgr-daemon instead of the mon-daemon
    in the CephFS drivers
upgrade:
  - |
    MON write caps are not longer needed to interact with the backend
    on the Ceph drivers. The capabilities of the driver user (configured with ``cephfs_auth_id``)
    can hence be reduced. See the `administrator docs <https://docs.openstack.org/manila/wallaby/admin/cephfs_driver.html#authorizing-the-driver-to-communicate-with-ceph>`_
    for the capabilities required.
