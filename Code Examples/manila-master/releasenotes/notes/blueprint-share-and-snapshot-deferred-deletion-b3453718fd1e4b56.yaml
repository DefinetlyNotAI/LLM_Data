    With deferred deletion, when resource(share or snapshot) is deleted, the
    quota is freed immediately and periodic tasks will delete the resource
    (i.e. share or snapshot) in driver. The resources errored during deletion
    are retried for deletion after some time in the same periodic tasks.
