    NetApp cDOT driver is now fixed to not trigger peer accept operation
    between share servers that belong to the same cluster, when handling share
    replica creation and promotion. This issue was happening when operating in
    `driver_handles_share_servers` enabled mode with multiple backends
    configured within the same cluster. See
    `Launchpad bug 1873963 <https://launchpad.net/bugs/1873963>`_ for more
    details.
