    For the latest Python 2.7 release, urllib uses the SSL certification
    while launching URL connection by default, which causes Huawei driver
    failed to connect backend storage because it doesn't support SSL
    certification.
    Utilize the requests lib for Huawei driver instead, and set no SSL
    certification for backend storage connection.
