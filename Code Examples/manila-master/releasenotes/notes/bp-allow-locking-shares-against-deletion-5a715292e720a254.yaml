    Added new API endpoints and methods to create, retrieve, update and
    delete resource locks. Resource locks can be used to restrict certain
    actions from occurring on the resource. Currently users can prevent
    deletion of a share (including soft-deletion, transfer and unmanage
    operations) by creating a resource lock against the share. In future
    releases, more resource actions may be supported by this feature.
