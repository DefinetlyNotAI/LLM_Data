    Manila now supports a "recycle bin" for shares. End users can soft-delete
    their shares and have the ability to restore them for a specified interval.
    This interval defaults to 7 days and is configurable via
    "soft_deleted_share_retention_time". After this time has elapsed,
    soft-deleted shares are automatically cleaned up.
upgrade:
  - |
    The share entity now contains two new fields: ``is_soft_deleted`` and
    ``scheduled_to_be_deleted_at``. The ``is_soft_deleted`` will be used to
    identify shares in the recycle bin.. The ``scheduled_to_be_deleted_at``
    field to show when the share will be deleted automatically. A new parameter
    called ``is_soft_deleted`` was added to the share list API, and users will
    be able to query shares and filter out the ones that are currently in the
    recycle bin.
