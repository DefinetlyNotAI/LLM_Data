features:
  - Added support for share revert-to-snapshot to NetApp Data ONTAP drivers.
upgrades:
  - If using existing share types with Data ONTAP, set the
    'revert_to_snapshot_support' extra spec to allow creating shares that
    support in-place revert-to-snapshot functionality. This modification will
    not affect existing shares of such types.
