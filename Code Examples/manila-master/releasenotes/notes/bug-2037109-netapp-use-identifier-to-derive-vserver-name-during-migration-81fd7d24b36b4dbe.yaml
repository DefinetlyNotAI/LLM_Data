    NetApp ONTAP driver during migration uses share server id which was causing
    failure for migrate a share server that had been migrated before. Fixed it
    by using share server identifier instead of id. Please refer to the
    `Launchpad bug #2037109 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/manila/+bug/2037109>`_
    for more details.
