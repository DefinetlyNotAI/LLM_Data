    Added support for Adaptive QoS policies that have been pre-created on
    the storage system, with clustered ONTAP version 9.4 or higher.  To use
    this feature, configure a Manila share type with the extra-spec
    "netapp:adaptive_qos_policy_group" and value set to the qos policy
    group on the ONTAP storage system, for example:

    netapp:adaptive_qos_policy_group=platform3

    Note that a cluster scoped account must be used in the driver
    configuration in order to use QoS in clustered ONTAP.  Other notes:

    - This only works for backends without share server management.
    - This does not work for share replicas or can fail when creating share
      from snapshot across backends, if the destination backend does not have
      the pre-created "adaptive_qos_policy_group".
