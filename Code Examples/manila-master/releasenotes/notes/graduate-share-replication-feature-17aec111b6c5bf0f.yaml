    Share replication APIs have graduated from their `experimental feature state
    <https://docs.openstack.org/manila/latest/contributor/experimental_apis.html>`_
    from API version ``2.56``. One or more share replicas can be created from a
    given share. They can also be promoted to be considered the active share,
    resynchronized and deleted. These actions no longer require the inclusion of
    ``X-OpenStack-Manila-API-Experimental`` header in the API requests.
