features:
  - |
    Create share from snapshot is now available in CephFS Native and CephFS NFS
    drivers. This feature is available in Ceph since the Ceph Nautilus release,
    so a deployment with Ceph Nautilus (v14.2.18 or higher) or Ceph Octopus (v15.2.10
    or higher) is required.
deprecations:
  - |
    The CephFS driver ``cephfs_enable_snapshots`` configuration option has been
    removed.  It was deprecated for removal in the Victoria release.  Snapshot
    support is always enabled now.
