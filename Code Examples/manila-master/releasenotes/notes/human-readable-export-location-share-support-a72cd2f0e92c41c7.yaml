  - A human readable ``mount_point_name`` can now be specified
    while creating shares through the mount_point_name parameter.

    can be configured through the ``provisioning:mount_point_prefix``
    share type extra spec. In case this extra spec is not available
    in the share type, Manila will prepend a project identification
    to the mount point name. Project id will be added to this friendly

    provided during provisioning. The LVM driver now supports
    human readable export locations.
