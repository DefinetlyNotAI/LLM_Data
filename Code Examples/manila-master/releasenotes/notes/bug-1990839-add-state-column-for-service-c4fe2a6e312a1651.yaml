    In cluster deployments, where multiple instances of manila services are
    deployed via PODs, unique hostname is derived from node name. However if
    pods are deployed again and launched on new hosts/nodes, the old entries
    of manila service remains as it is. Fixed it by adding per service cleanup
    function and also introducing 'state' column in 'services' table. The
    service will be in either of 'up', 'down' or 'stopped' state. Cleanup will
    delete DB entries of 'stopeed' services. For more details please refer,
