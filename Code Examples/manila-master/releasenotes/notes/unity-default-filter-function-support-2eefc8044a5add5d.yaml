    A new configuration option called ``report_default_filter_function`` has
    been added to the Dell EMC Unity driver. It can be set to True or False,
    and the default value is False. When set to True, the scheduler will
    disallow the creation of shares smaller than 3 GiB on the Dell EMC Unity
    back end. The default value of this option will be changed to ``True`` in
    a future release, so always set the desired value in your manila.conf per
    your expectations.
