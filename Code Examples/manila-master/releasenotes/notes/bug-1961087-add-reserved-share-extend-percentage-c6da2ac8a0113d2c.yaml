    'reserved_share_extend_percentage' backend config option allows
    Manila to consider different reservation percentage for share extend
    operation.
    This distinct option is useful if operators want to prevent provisioning
    of new shares but allow extensions of existing shares on storage pools
    beyond their reserved space.
