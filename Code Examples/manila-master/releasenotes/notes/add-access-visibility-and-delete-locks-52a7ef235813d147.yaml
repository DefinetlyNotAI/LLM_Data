    Added the possibility to lock the deletion of access rules, as well as the
    visibility of the sensitive fields `access_to` and `access_type` while
    creating share access rules. When the visibility is restricted, only the
    owner or more privileged users will be able to visualize the context of
    the sensitive fields.
    Both locks can also be imposed by the recently introduced resource locks
    APIs.

    It is now possible to filter access rules based on the `access_to`,
    `access_type`, `access_key` and `access_level` keys.
