fixes:
  - The NetApp DHSS=True driver now creates static routes with the gateway
    specified on the tenant networks. Potential beneficiaries of this bug-fix
    are deployers/users whose CIFS security service (e.g. Active Directory)
    is not part of the tenant network, but a route exists via the tenant
    network gateway.
