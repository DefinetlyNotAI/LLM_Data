features:
  - The NetApp cDOT drivers now include the cluster node utilization
    metrics for each pool reported to the manila scheduler. These
    values are designed to be included in the filter & goodness functions
    used by the scheduler, so the cDOT drivers now also report those
    functions to the scheduler for each pool.
