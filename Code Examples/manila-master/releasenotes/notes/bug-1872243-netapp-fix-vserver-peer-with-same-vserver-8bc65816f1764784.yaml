    NetApp cDOT driver is now fixed to not create peer relationship between
    same share servers when handling share replica creation and promotion.
    This issue was happening when operating in `driver_handles_share_servers`
    enabled mode with backends configured with more than one pool. See
    `Launchpad bug 1872243 <https://launchpad.net/bugs/1872243>`_ for more
    details.
