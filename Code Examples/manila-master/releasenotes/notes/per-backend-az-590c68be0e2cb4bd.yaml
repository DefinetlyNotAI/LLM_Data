features:
  - |
    Availability zones may now be configured per backend in a multi-backend
    configuration. Individual back end sections can now have the configuration
    option ``backend_availability_zone`` set. If set, this value will override
    the ``storage_availability_zone`` option from the [DEFAULT] section.
upgrade:
  - The ``storage_availability_zone`` option can now be overridden per
    backend by using the ``backend_availability_zone`` option within the
    backend stanza. This allows enabling multiple storage backends that may
    be deployed in different AZs in the same ``manila.conf`` file if
    desired, simplifying service architecture around the Share Replication
    feature.
