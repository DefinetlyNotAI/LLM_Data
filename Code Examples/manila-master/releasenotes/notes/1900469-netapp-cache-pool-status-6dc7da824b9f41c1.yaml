    In order to optimize the NetApp ONTAP driver, this patch is caching
    the status of driver pools and reusing for the each share server, given
    that the pool is not separated by share server. It adds the option
    `netapp_cached_aggregates_status_lifetime` for controlling the time that
    the cached values is considered valid. Please refer to the
    `Launchpad bug #1900469 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/manila/+bug/1900469>`_
    for more details.
