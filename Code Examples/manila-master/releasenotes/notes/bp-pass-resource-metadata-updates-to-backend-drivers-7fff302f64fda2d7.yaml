    OpenStack operators can now make use of a new config option named
    `driver_updatable_metadata` to determine which share metadata updates the
    back end driver needs to be notified about. The config option contains
    list of share metadata keys. When the share's metadata gets updated and
    Manila identifies that the new metadata keys match the metadata keys from
    the provided list, the share back end will be notified and it will apply
    the necessary changes. The result will be communicated through user
    messages.
