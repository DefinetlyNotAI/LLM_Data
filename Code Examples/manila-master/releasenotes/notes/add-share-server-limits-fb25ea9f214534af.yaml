    Two new backend capabilities were added to Manila in order to help
    administrators to control and balance their cloud resources. The capability
    called `max_shares_per_share_server` allows the administrators to define a
    maximum amount of shares that a share server can have. The capability called
    `max_share_server_size` allows the administrator to set a maximum number of
    gigabytes a share server can grow to, considering its instances, replicas and
    snapshots. Both capabilities accept only integer values. If at least one of
    these limits is reached, Manila won't consider reusing the referred share
    server. If there aren't share servers available to reuse, Manila will create
    another one to place incoming request. If none of these limits were specified
    in the backend stanza, Manila will consider them as unlimited and allow share
    servers to be reused regardless the amount of shares or the size they have.
