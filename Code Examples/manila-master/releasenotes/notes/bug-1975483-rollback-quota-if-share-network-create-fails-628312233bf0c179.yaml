    During share network create API, if either share network or share network
    subnet db creation fails, manila raises an exception. However quota is not
    rolled back and its usable only after quota reservations timed out (waiting
    conf.reservation_expire seconds). Fixed by introducing immediate quota
    rollback in case any db create api fails.
