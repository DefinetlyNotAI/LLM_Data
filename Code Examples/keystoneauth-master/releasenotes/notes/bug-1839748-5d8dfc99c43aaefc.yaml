    [`bug 1839748 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystoneauth/+bug/1839748>`_]
    Keystoneauth now supports MFA authentication and Auth Receipts.
    Responses from Keystone containing and auth receipt will now
    raise a ``MissingAuthMethods`` exception which will contain the
    auth receipt itself, and information about the missing methods.
    There are now also ways to easily do more than one method when
    authenticating to Keystone and those have been documented.
