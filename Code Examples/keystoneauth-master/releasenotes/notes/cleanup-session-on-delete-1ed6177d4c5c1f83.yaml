    [`bug 1838704 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1838704>`_]
    When consuming keystoneauth1.session.Session, if a requests session is not
    provided one is created. The Session used for requests may result in a
    ResourceWarning being generated if it is not properly closed. The code
    has been updated to close the session correctly when the Session object
    is deleted.
