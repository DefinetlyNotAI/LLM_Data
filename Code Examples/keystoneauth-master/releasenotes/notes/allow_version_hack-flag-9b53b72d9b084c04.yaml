features:
  - A new flag `allow_version_hack` was added to identity plugins and the
    adapter which will allow a client to opt out of making guesses at the
    version url page of a service. This means that if a deployment is
    misconfigured and the service catalog contains a versioned endpoint that
    does not match the requested version the request will fail. This will be
    useful in beginning to require correctly deployed catalogs rather than
    continue to hide the problem.
