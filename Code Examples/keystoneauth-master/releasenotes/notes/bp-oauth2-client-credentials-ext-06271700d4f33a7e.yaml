    [`blueprint oauth2-client-credentials-ext <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/keystone/+spec/oauth2-client-credentials-ext>`_]
    Added a new OAuth2ClientCredential plugin, accessible via the
    'v3oauth2clientcredential' entry point, making possible to authenticate
    using an application credentials as an OAuth2.0 client credentials.
    Keystoneauth can now be used to access the OpenStack APIs that use the
    keystone middleware to support OAuth2.0 client credentials authentication
    through the keystone identity server.
