    [`blueprint support-oauth2-mtls <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/keystone/+spec/support-oauth2-mtls>`_]
    Added a new OAuth2mTlsClientCredential plugin, accessible via the
    'v3oauth2mtlsclientcredential' entry point, making possible to authenticate
    using an OAuth 2.0 Mutual-TLS client credentials. Keystoneauth can now
    be used to access the OpenStack APIs that use the keystone middleware to
    support OAuth2.0 mutual-TLS client authentication through the keystone
    identity server.
