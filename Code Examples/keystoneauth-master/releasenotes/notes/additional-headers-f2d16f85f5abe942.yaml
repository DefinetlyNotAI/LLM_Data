    Allow specifying additional_headers to the session and the adapter to add
    headers to all requests that pass through these objects.
features:
  - Add the ability to provide additional_headers to the session and adapter
    object. This will allow clients particularly to provide additional ways to
    identify their requests. It will also hopefully provide an intermediate way
    to handle setting microversions until we support them directly with
    keystoneauth.
