prelude: >
    Allow adding client and application name and version to the session and
    adapter that will generate a userful user agent string.
features:
  - You can specify a ``app_name`` and ``app_version`` when creating a
    session. This information will be encoded into the user agent.
  - You can specify a ``client_name`` and ``client_version`` when creating an
    adapter. This will be handled by client libraries and incluced into the user
    agent.
  - Libraries like shade that modify the way requests are made can add
    themselves to additional_user_agent and have their version reflected in the
    user agent string.
deprecations:
  - We suggest you fill the name and version for the application and client
    instead of specifying a custom ``user_agent``. This will then generate a
    standard user agent string.
