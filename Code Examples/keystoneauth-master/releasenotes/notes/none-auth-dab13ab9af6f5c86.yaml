    A new ``none`` auth plugin is added with purpose to simplify loading
    clients from configuration file options.
    It does not accept any arguments and sets the token to 'notused'.
    It does not have any endpoint/url associated with it,
    and thus must be used together with ``adapter.Adapter``'s
    ``endpoint_override`` option to instantiate a session for client
    to a service that is deployed in noauth/standalone mode.
