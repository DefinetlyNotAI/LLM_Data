    Added ``collect_timing`` option to ``keystoneauth1.session.Session``.
    The option, which is off by default, causes the ``Session`` to collect
    API timing information for every call it makes. Methods ``get_timings``
    and ``reset_timings`` have been added to allow getting and clearing the
    data.
