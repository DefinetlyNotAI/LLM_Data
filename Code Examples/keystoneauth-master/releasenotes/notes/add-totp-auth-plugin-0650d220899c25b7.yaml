   [`blueprint totp-auth <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/keystone/+spec/totp-auth>`_]
   Add an auth plugin to handle Time-Based One-Time Password (TOTP)
   authentication via the ``totp`` method. This new plugin will accept the
   following identity options:

   - ``user-id``: user ID
   - ``username``: username
   - ``user-domain-id``: user's domain ID
   - ``user-domain-name``: user's domain name
   - ``passcode``: passcode generated by TOTP app or device

   User is uniquely identified by either ``user-id`` or combination of
   ``username`` and ``user-domain-id`` or ``user-domain-name``.
