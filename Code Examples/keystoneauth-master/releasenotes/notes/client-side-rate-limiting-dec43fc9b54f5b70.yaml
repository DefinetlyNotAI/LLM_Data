    Support added for client-side rate limiting. Two new parameters now
    exist for ``keystoneauth1.adapter.Adapter``. ``rate`` expresses a
    maximum rate at which to execute requests. ``parallel_limit`` allows
    for the creation of a semaphore to control the maximum number of
    requests that can be active at any one given point in time.
    Both default to ``None`` which has the normal behavior or not limiting
    requests in any manner.
