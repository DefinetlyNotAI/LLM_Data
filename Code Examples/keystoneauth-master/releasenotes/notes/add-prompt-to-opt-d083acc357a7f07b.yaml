    Add the prompt parameter to loader Opts
features:
  - The prompt parameter was added to the Opts provided by auth plugins. The
    presence of the prompt parameter on an Option will indicate to plugin
    loaders that it is ok to prompt the user for input for this parameter if
    none is provided initially. Actual implementation of this prompting
    mechanism will be handled by the individual loaders such as
    os-client-config.
