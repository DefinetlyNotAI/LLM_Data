    [`blueprint system-scope <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/keystone/+spec/system-scope>`_]
    Keystoneauth now has the ability to authenticate for system-scoped tokens,
    which were implemented during the Queens development cycle. System-scoped
    tokens will eventually be required to separate system-level APIs from
    project-level APIs, allowing for better security via scoped RBAC.
