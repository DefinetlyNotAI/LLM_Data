features:
  - Added support for the API Working Group recommendations
    on service and version discovery. New methods on
    Session and Adapter, "get_endpoint_data" will return
    endpoint metadata including microversion information.
    Additionally, versions can be requested with a range
    and with the string "latest", and interface values
    can be given as a list in case a user wants to express
    a 'best available' set of preferences.
