    [`feature bug 1840235 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystoneauth/+bug/1840235>`_]
    Adds ``connect_retries`` to Session.__init__(), that can then be used
    by projects when creating session objects, to set the required number of
    retries for new connection requests. This would specifically help avoid
    a scalability issue that results in number of  ConnectTimeout errors when
    doing endpoint discovery and fetching roles using an auth plugin under
    heavy load. This still allows for it to be overridden per service with
    the adapter interface.
