    Fixes a condition where URL parameters would be appended to a
    new URL discovered via a redirect. This was resulting in arguments
    being duplicated on requests to the new server being redirected to.
    URL redirects are intended to redirect the requester to the final
    location, and generally include a fully formatted final destination
    URL, which would include URL parameters. URL parameters are now dropped
    when attempting to issue a request once redirected.
