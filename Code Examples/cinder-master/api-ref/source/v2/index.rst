==============================
Block Storage API V2 (REMOVED)
==============================

.. note::
    Version 2 of the Block Storage API was `deprecated in the Pike release
    <https://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/cinder/pike.html#deprecation-notes>`_
    and was removed during the Xena development cycle.  `This document is
    maintained for historical purposes only.`

    `Version 3
    <https://docs.openstack.org/api-ref/block-storage/v3/>`_
    of the Block Storage API was `introduced in the Mitaka release
    <https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/cinder/+/224910>`_.  Version
    3.0, which is the default microversion at the ``/v3`` endpoint, was
    designed to be identical to version 2.  Thus, scripts using the Block
    Storage API v2 should be adaptable to version 3 with minimal changes.
