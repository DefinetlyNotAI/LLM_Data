==============================
Block Storage API V3 (CURRENT)
==============================

.. note::

   The URL for most API methods includes a ``{project_id}`` placeholder that
   represents the caller's project ID. As of v3.67, the project_id is optional
   in the URL, and the following are equivalent:

   * ``GET /v3/{project_id}/volumes``
   * ``GET /v3/volumes``

   In both instances, the actual project ID used by the API method is the one
   in the caller's keystone context. For that reason, including a project ID in
   the URL is redundant.

   The v3.67 microversion is only used as an indicator that the API accepts a
   URL without a ``{project_id}`` segment, and this applies to all requests
   regardless of the microversion in the request. For example, an API node
   serving v3.67 or greater will accept a URL without a ``{project_id}``
   segment even if the request asks for v3.0. Likewise, it will accept a URL
   containing a ``{project_id}`` segment even if the request asks for v3.67.
