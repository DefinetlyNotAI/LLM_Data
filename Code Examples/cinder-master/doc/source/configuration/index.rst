.. warning::

   For security reasons **Service Tokens must be configured** in OpenStack
   for Cinder to operate securely. Pay close attention to the :doc:`specific
   section describing it: <block-storage/service-token>`. See
   https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/2004555 for details.

.. note::

   The examples of common configurations for shared
   service and libraries, such as database connections and
   RPC messaging, can be seen in Cinder's sample configuration
   file: `cinder.conf.sample <../_static/cinder.conf.sample>`_.

The Block Storage service works with many different storage
drivers that you can configure by using these instructions.
