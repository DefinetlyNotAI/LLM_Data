Cinder Driver Support Matrix
============================

The following support matrix reflects the drivers that are currently
available or are available in
`Cinder's driver tree <https://opendev.org/openstack/cinder/src/branch/master/cinder/volume/drivers>`_
at the time of release.

.. note::

  This matrix replaces the old wiki based version of the Cinder Support
  Matrix as there was no way to ensure the wiki version was properly
  maintained.  The old matrix will be left for reference but
  this matrix should be treated as the correct state of Cinder.

.. _required_driver_functions:

Required Driver Functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are a number of functions that are required to be accepted as
a Cinder driver.  Rather than list all the required functionality in the
matrix we include the list of required functions here for reference.

* Create Volume
* Delete Volume
* Attach Volume
* Detach Volume
* Extend Volume
* Create Snapshot
* Delete Snapshot
* Create Volume from Snapshot
* Create Volume from Volume (clone)
* Create Image from Volume
* Volume Migration (host assisted)

.. note::

  Since the above functions are required their support is assumed and the
  matrix only includes support for optional functionality.

.. note::
  This matrix is not dynamically generated. It is maintained by the Cinder
  team and Vendor driver maintainers. While every effort is made to ensure
  the accuracy of the data in this matrix, discrepancies with actual
  functionality are possible. Please refer to your vendor's support
  documentation for additional information.
