Failed to connect volume in FC SAN
==================================

Problem
~~~~~~~

The compute node failed to connect to a volume in a Fibre Channel (FC) SAN
configuration. The WWN may not be zoned correctly in your FC SAN that
links the compute host to the storage array:

Solution
~~~~~~~~

The network administrator must configure the FC SAN fabric by correctly
zoning the WWN (port names) from your compute node HBAs.
