upgrade:
  - |
    The Block Storage API v2, which was deprecated in the Pike release,
    has been removed.  If upgrading from a previous OpenStack release, it
    is recommended that you edit your ``/etc/cinder/api-paste.ini`` file
    to remove all references to v2.  Additionally, the deprecated
    configuration option ``enable_v2_api`` has been removed.  If present
    in a configuration file, it will be silently ignored.

    The configuration option ``enable_v3_api`` has been removed from this
    release due to the fact that v3 is now the only version of the Block
    Storage API available.  If present in a configuration file, it will
    be silently ignored as the v3 API is now enabled unconditionally.
