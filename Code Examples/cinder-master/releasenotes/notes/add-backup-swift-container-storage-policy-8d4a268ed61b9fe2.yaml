    Swift backup driver: Added new configuration option ``backup_swift_create_storage_policy``
    for the Swift backup driver. If specified it will be used as the storage policy when
    creating the Swift Container, default value is None meaning it will not be used and Swift
    will use the system default. Please note that this only applies if a container doesn't exist
    as we cannot update the storage policy on an already existing container.
