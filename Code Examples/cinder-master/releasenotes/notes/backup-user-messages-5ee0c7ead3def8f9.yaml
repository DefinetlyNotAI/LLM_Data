    Added user messages for backup operations that a user
    can query through the `Messages API
    <https://docs.openstack.org/api-ref/block-storage/v3/#messages-messages>`_.
    These allow users to retrieve error messages for asynchronous
    failures in backup operations like create, delete, and restore.
