    NetApp ONTAP `bug #1958245
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1958245>`_: In an ONTAP
    flexgroup replication environment, snapmirror creation would
    succeed but a driver bug caused an error message to be logged
    for the cinder-volume service. The issue has been corrected in
    this release.
