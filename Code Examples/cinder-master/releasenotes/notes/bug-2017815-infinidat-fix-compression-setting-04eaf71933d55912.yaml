    Infinidat driver `bug #2017815
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/2017815>`_:
    Fixed Infinidat driver to inherit compression setting by default for
    all newly created volumes. Admin can set ``True`` or ``False`` for
    the ``infinidat_use_compression`` option in the driver section
    of ``cinder.conf`` to explicitly enable or disable compression setting
    for all newly created volumes. Or leave this option unset (commented out)
    for all created volumes to inherit their compression setting from their
    parent pool at creation time. The default value is unset.
upgrade:
  - |
    Infinidat driver: support has been removed for pre-v3.0 InfiniBox systems.
    These versions are end of life and have not been supported for a long time.
