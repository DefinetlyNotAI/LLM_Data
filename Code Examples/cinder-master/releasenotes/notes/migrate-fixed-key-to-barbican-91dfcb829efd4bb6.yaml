    When Barbican is the encryption key_manager backend, any encryption keys
    associated with the legacy ConfKeyManager will be automatically migrated
    to Barbican. All database references to the ConfKeyManager's all-zeros key
    ID will be updated with a Barbican key ID. The encryption keys do not
    change. Only the encryption key ID changes.

    Key migration is initiated on service startup, and entries in the
    cinder-volume log will indicate the migration status. Log entries will
    indicate when a volume's encryption key ID has been migrated to Barbican,
    and a summary log message will indicate when key migration has finished.
