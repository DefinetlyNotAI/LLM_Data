    `Bug #1894086 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1894086>`_:
    PowerMax Cinder driver addresses an issue whereby Unisphere REST iterators
    expire before all data can be read from them. The iterator expiration is now
    set to 180mins and deleted once all data has been read so no artifacts are
    left behind.
