    RBD driver `bug #1942210
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1942210>`_: When
    creating a volume from a snapshot, the operation could
    fail due to an uncaught exception being raised during a
    check to see if the backend Ceph installation supported
    the clone v2 API.  The driver now handles this situation
    gracefully.
