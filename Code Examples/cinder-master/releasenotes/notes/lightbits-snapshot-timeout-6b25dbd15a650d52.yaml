    Lightbits driver: Added support to create multiple snapshots
    from the same volume simultaneously when using the Lightbits
    cinder driver. Under certain conditions, older releases of the
    Lightbits api-service will return various status codes (including
    HTTP status codes 500 and 503) that could indicate transient
    failures. Added retry logic on such errors becuase there's a good
    chance that the error is transient and subsequent calls will
    succeed.
