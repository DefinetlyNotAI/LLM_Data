fixes:
  - After transferring a volume without snapshots from one user project
    to another user project, if the receiving user uses cascade deleting,
    it will cause some exceptions in driver and volume will be error_deleting.
    Adding additional check to ensure there are no snapshots left in other
    project when cascade deleting a tranferred volume.
