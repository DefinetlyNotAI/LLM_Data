    `Bug #1432387 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1432387>`_: Add a
    command to cinder-manage to clean up file locks existing in hosts where
    there is a Cinder service running (API, Scheduler, Volume, Backup).
    Command works with the Cinder services running, useful to be called as a
    cron job, as well as stopped, to be called on host startup.  Command
    invocation ``cinder-manage util clean_locks`` with optional parameter
    ``--services-offline``.
