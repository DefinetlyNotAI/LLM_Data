    `Bug #1988942 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1988942>`_: Increased
    size of volume image metadata values accepted by the Block Storage API.
    Volume image metadata values were limited to 255 characters but Glance
    allows up to 65535 bytes. This change does not affect the database
    tables which already allow up to 65535 bytes for image metadata values.
