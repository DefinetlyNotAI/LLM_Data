    Added a new optional cache of volumes generated from snapshots for the
    Quobyte backend. Enabling this cache speeds up creation of multiple
    volumes from a single snapshot at the cost of a slight increase in
    creation time for the first volume generated for this given snapshot.
    The ``quobyte_volume_from_snapshot_cache`` option is off by default.
