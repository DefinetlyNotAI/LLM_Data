    In IBM Storwize_SVC driver, user could specify only one IO
    group per backend definition. The user now may specify a comma separated
    list of IO groups, and at the time of creating the volume, the driver will
    select an IO group which has the least number of volumes associated with
    it. The change is backward compatible, meaning single value is still
    supported.
