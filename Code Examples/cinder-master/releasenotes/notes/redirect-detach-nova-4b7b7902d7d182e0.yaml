    Detaching volumes will fail if Nova is not `configured to send service
    tokens <https://docs.openstack.org/cinder/latest/configuration/block-storage/service-token.html>`_,
    please read the upgrade section for more information. (`Bug #2004555

    Nova must be `configured to send service tokens
    <https://docs.openstack.org/cinder/latest/configuration/block-storage/service-token.html>`_
    **and** cinder must be configured to recognize at least one of the roles
    that the nova service user has been assigned in keystone. By default,
    cinder will recognize the ``service`` role, so if the nova service user
    is assigned a differently named role in your cloud, you must adjust your
    cinder configuration file (``service_token_roles`` configuration option
    in the ``keystone_authtoken`` section). If nova and cinder are not
    configured correctly in this regard, detaching volumes will no longer
    work (`Bug #2004555 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/2004555>`_).
security:

    As part of the fix for `Bug #2004555
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/2004555>`_, cinder now rejects
    user attachment delete requests for attachments that are being used by nova
    instances to ensure that no leftover devices are produced on the compute
    nodes which could be used to access another project's volumes.  Terminate
    connection, detach, and force detach volume actions (calls that are not
    usually made by users directly) are, in most cases, not allowed for users.
fixes:
  - |
    `Bug #2004555 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/2004555>`_: Fixed
    issue where a user manually deleting an attachment, calling terminate
    connection, detach, or force detach, for a volume that is still used by a
    nova instance resulted in leftover devices on the compute node. These
    operations will now fail when it is believed to be a problem.
issues:
  - |
    For security reasons (`Bug #2004555
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/2004555>`_) manually deleting an
    attachment, manually doing the ``os-terminate_connection``, ``os-detach``
    or ``os-force_detach`` actions will no longer be allowed in most cases
    unless the request is coming from another OpenStack service on behalf of a
    user.
