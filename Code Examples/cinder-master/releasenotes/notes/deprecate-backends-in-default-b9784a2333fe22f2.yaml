upgrade:
  - Any Volume Drivers configured in the ``DEFAULT`` config stanza should be moved
    to their own stanza and enabled via the ``enabled_backends`` config option.
    The older style of config with ``DEFAULT`` is deprecated and will be
    removed in future releases.
deprecations:
  - Configuring Volume Drivers in the ``DEFAULT`` config stanza is not going to be
    maintained and will be removed in the next release. All backends should use
    the ``enabled_backends`` config option with separate stanza's for each.
