upgrade:
  - |
    The default value has been removed for the LVM specific
    `lvm_max_over_subscription_ratio` setting. This changes the behavior so
    that LVM backends now adhere to the common `max_over_subscription_ratio`
    setting. The LVM specific config option may still be used, but it is
    now deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
deprecations:
  - |
    The `lvm_max_overprovision_ratio` config option has been deprecated. It
    will be removed in a future release. Configurations should move to using
    the common `max_overprovision_ratio` config option.
