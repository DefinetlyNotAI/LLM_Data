    Welcome to the Xena release of the OpenStack Block Storage service
    (cinder).  With this release, the Block Storage API version 3 has
    reached microversion **3.66**.  The cinder team would like to
    bring the following points to your attention.  Details may be
    found below.

    * The Block Storage API v2, which was deprecated way back in the
      Pike release, has been removed.  We gently remind you that Pike
      was a long time ago, and that version 3.0 of the Block Storage
      API was designed to be completely compatible with version 2.

    * Microversion 3.65 includes the display of information in the
      volume or snapshot detail response to indicate whether that
      resource consumes quota, and adds the ability to filter a
      requested list of resources according to whether they consume
      quota or not.

    * Microversion 3.66 removes the necessity to add a 'force' flag
      when requesting a snapshot of an in-use volume, given that this
      is not a problem for modern storage systems.

    * The volume-type detail response has been enhanced to include
      non-sensitive "extra-specs" information in order to provide more
      data for automated systems to select a volume type.

    * The default policy configuration has been extensively rewritten.

    * Many backend storage drivers have added features and fixed bugs.
