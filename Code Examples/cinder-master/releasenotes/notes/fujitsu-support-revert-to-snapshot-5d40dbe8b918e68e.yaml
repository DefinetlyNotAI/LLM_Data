    Fujitsu Eternus DX driver: Added support for revert to snapshot operation.

    Added support of revert to snapshot functionality.

    If a volume with snapshots has been extended, causing a mismatch in size
    between the origin volume and the snapshot, reverting will be guarded by
    cinder-api.
