    Dell EMC ScaleIO has been renamed to Dell EMC VxFlex OS.
    Documentation for the driver can be found under the new name.
    The driver maintains full backwards compatability with prior
    ScaleIO releases and no configuration changes are needed upon
    upgrade to the new version of the driver.
