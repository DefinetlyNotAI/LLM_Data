    In this release, sending ``os-reset_status`` notifications to the
    following *nonstandard* publisher_ids is DEPRECATED:

    * 'volumeStatusUpdate' for volume status resets
    * 'volumeStatusUpdate' for snapshot status resets
    * 'backupStatusUpdate' for backup status resets

    The notifications continue to be published to the above during the
    deprecation period.  Beginning with this release, the ``os-reset_status``
    notifications are also sent to the following *standard* publisher_ids:

    * 'volume' for volume status resets
    * 'snapshot' for snapshot status resets
    * 'backup' for backup status resets

    This will allow consumers of these notifications to make a smooth
    transition.  In the Victoria release, ``os-reset_status`` notifications
    will *only* be sent to the standard publisher_ids.
fixes:

    ``os-reset_status`` notifications for volumes, snapshots and backups will
    now go to the standard publisher id for volume, snapshot and backup like
    all other notifications for volume, snapshot and backup.
