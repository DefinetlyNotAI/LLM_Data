    Some of DISCO driver options were incorrectly read from ``[DEFAULT]``
    section in the cinder.conf. Now those are correctly read from
    ``[<backend_id>]`` section. This includes following options:

    * ``disco_client``
    * ``disco_client_port``
    * ``rest_ip``
    * ``choice_client``
    * ``disco_src_api_port``
    * ``retry_interval``

    Also some options are renamed (note that 3 of them were both moved and
    renamed):

    * ``rest_ip`` to ``disco_rest_ip``
    * ``choice_client`` to ``disco_choice_client``
    * ``volume_name_prefix`` to ``disco_volume_name_prefix``
    * ``snapshot_check_timeout`` to ``disco_snapshot_check_timeout``
    * ``restore_check_timeout`` to ``disco_restore_check_timeout``
    * ``clone_check_timeout`` to ``disco_clone_check_timeout``
    * ``retry_interval`` to ``disco_retry_interval``

    Old names and locations are still supported but support will be removed in
    the future.
