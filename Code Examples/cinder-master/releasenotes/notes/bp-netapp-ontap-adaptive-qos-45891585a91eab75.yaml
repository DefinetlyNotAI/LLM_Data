    NetApp ONTAP driver: Added support for Adaptive QoS specs. The driver now
    accepts ``expectedIOPSperGiB``, ``peakIOPSperGiB``, ``expectedIOPSAllocation``,
    ``peakIOPSAllocation``, ``absoluteMinIOPS`` and ``blockSize``. The field
    ``peakIOPSperGiB`` and the field ``expectedIOPSperGiB`` are required together.
    The ``expectedIOPSperGiB`` and ``absoluteMinIOPS`` specs are only guaranteed
    by ONTAP AFF systems. All specs can only be used with ONTAP version equal
    or greater than 9.4, excepting the ``expectedIOPSAllocation`` and
    ``blockSize`` specs which require at least 9.5.
