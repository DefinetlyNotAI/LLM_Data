    Dell EMC PowerMax driver now faciliates the user to override the
    short host name and port group name seen in PowerMax masking view
    and storage view terminology. This means the user can give more
    meaningful names, especially when the short host name exceeds 16
    characters and the port group name exceeds 12 characters, which
    is the condition where the driver truncates these values.
