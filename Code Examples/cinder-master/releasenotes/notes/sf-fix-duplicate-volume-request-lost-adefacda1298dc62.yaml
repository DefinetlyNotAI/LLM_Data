    NetApp SolidFire driver `Bug #1896112
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1896112>`_:
    Fixes an issue that may duplicate volumes during creation, in case
    the SolidFire backend successfully processes a request and creates
    the volume, but fails to deliver the result back to the driver (the
    response is lost). When this scenario occurs, the SolidFire driver
    will retry the operation, which previously resulted in the creation
    of a duplicate volume. This fix adds the ``sf_volume_create_timeout``
    configuration option (default value: 60 seconds) which specifies an
    additional length of time that the driver will wait for the volume to
    become active on the backend before raising an exception.
