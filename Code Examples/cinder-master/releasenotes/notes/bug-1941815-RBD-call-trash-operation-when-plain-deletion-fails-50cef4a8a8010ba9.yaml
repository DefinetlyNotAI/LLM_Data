    **RBD driver: Enable Ceph V2 Clone API and Ceph Trash auto purge**

    In light of the fix for RBD driver `bug #1941815
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1941815>`_, we want to
    bring the following information to your attention.

    Using the v2 clone format for cloned volumes allows volumes with
    dependent images to be moved to the trash - where they remain
    until purged - and allow the RBD driver to postpone the deletion
    until the volume has no dependent images. Configuring the trash
    purge is recommended to avoid wasting space with these trashed
    volumes. Since the Ceph Octopus release, the trash can be
    configured to automatically purge on a defined schedule.
    See the ``rbd trash purge schedule`` commands in the `rbd manpage
    <https://docs.ceph.com/en/octopus/man/8/rbd/>`_.
