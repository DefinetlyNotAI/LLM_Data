    `Bug #1978729 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1978729>`_: Fixed
    context.message_action is None on errors by backup drivers. The message_*
    properties of the context were not passed during rpc, which caused a double
    exception when a backup driver raised an exception, masking the actual backup
    driver exception.
