    Add 'LUNType' configuration verification for Huawei driver when
    connecting to Dorado array. Because Dorado array only supports
    'Thin' lun type, so 'LUNType' only can be configured as 'Thin',
    any other type is invalid and if 'LUNType' not explicitly configured,
    by default use 'Thin' for Dorado array.
