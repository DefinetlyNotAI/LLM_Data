    The Veritas HyperScale storage driver has been removed after completion of its
    deprecation period without a reliable 3rd Party CI system being
    supported.  Customers using the Veritas HyperScale driver should not upgrade
    Cinder without first migrating all volumes from their Veritas backend
    to a supported storage backend.  Failure to migrate volumes will
    result in no longer being able to access volumes backed by the Veritas
    HyperScale storage backend.

    The Veritas HyperScale storage driver was marked unsupported  in Stein due to
    3rd Party CI not meeting Cinder's requirements.  As a result the
    driver is removed starting from the Train release.
