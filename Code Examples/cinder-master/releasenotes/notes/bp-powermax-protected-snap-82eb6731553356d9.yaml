    Dell EMC PowerMax driver: Added SRDF ``powermax:disable_protected_snap``
    volume-type extra-spec property for the purpose of avoiding
    overconsumption on both source and target storage arrays.

    An operator may enable this functionality by creating a specific volume
    type with the property::

        "powermax:disable_protected_snap": "<is> True"

    When disabled (which is the default and current behavior), a
    replicated source volume will be protected with a snapshot of the
    same volume type.

    When enabled, snapshots of replicated source volumes will be treated
    as regular, non-replicated devices.
