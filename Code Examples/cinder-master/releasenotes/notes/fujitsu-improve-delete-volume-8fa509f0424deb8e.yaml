    Fujitsu ETERNUS DX driver: Improve volume deletion

    To improve the volume deletion process, add a step to check associated copy
    sessions. Additionally, it also improves the process of retrieving
    storage-managed volume numbers.

    There was a problem where the volume could not be deleted because the copy
    session information acquired by SMI-S IF from ETERNUS DX Storage, which was
    cached and did not reflect the information that had just been executed.

    This problem has been addressed through improvements in information
    retrieval.
