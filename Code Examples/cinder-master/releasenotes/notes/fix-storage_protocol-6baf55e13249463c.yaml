    The ``storage_protocol`` treats all variants of the protocol name as the
    same regarding matches, so for example using FC, fc, or fibre_channel will
    be treated equally in the scheduler, be it when filtering using the volume
    type's extra specs or when using filter and goodness functions.

    The storage protocol reporting via the REST API will be now the same for
    them all, using the preferred naming, FC, NVMe-oF, iSCSI, NFS...

    If your deployment uses ``storage_protocol`` to differentiate between
    backends that use the same protocol but report it using different variants,
    be aware that they will no longer be differentiated.

    inconsistent behavior of ``storage_protocol`` among different backends that
    report variants of the protocol name, such as FC, fc, fibre_channel.
