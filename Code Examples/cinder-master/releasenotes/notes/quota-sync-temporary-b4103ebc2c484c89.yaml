    `Bug #1919161 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1919161>`_: Fix
    automatic quota refresh to correctly account for temporary volumes. During
    some cinder operations, such as create a backup from a snapshot, temporary
    volumes are created and are not counted towards quota usage, but the sync
    mechanism was counting them, thus incorrectly updating volume usage.
