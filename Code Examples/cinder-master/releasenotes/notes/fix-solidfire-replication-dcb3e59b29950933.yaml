    The SolidFire replication was fixed. Several bugs were addressed (creating
    replicated volumes from snapshots, from volumes, retype a volume to a
    replicated type, managing a volume to a replicated type, correctly
    updating portal info on failover/failback and some minor
    other fixes). Closes bugs #1834013, #1751932.
