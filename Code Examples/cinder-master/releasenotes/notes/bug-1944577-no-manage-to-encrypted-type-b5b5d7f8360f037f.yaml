    `Bug #1944577 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1944577>`_:
    Managing a volume to an encrypted type was never a good idea because
    there was no way to specify an encryption key ID so that the volume
    could be used.  Requests to manage a volume to an encrypted volume
    type now result in an invalid request response.
