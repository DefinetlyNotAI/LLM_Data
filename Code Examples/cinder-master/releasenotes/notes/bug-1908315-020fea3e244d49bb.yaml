    This release contains a fix for `Bug #1908315
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1908315>`_, which changes the
    default value of the policy governing the Block Storage API action
    `Reset group snapshot status
    <https://docs.openstack.org/api-ref/block-storage/v3/#reset-group-snapshot-status>`_
    to make the action administrator-only.  This policy was inadvertently
    changed to be admin-or-owner during the Queens development cycle.

    The policy is named ``group:reset_group_snapshot_status``.

    * If you have a custom value for this policy in your cinder policy
      configuration file, this change to the default value will not affect
      you.
    * If you have been aware of this regression and like the current
      (incorrect) behavior, you may add the following line to your cinder
      policy configuration file to restore that behavior::

          "group:reset_group_snapshot_status": "rule:admin_or_owner"

      This setting is *not recommended* by the Cinder project team, as it
      may allow end users to put a group snapshot into an invalid status with
      indeterminate consequences.

    For more information about the cinder policy configuration file, see the
    `policy.yaml
    <https://docs.openstack.org/cinder/latest/configuration/block-storage/samples/policy.yaml.html>`_
    section of the Cinder Configuration Guide.

    `Bug #1908315 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1908315>`_: Corrected
    the default checkstring for the ``group:reset_group_snapshot_status``
    policy to make it admin-only.  This policy governs the Block Storage API
    action `Reset group snapshot status
    <https://docs.openstack.org/api-ref/block-storage/v3/#reset-group-snapshot-status>`_,
    which by default is supposed to be an adminstrator-only action.
