      In certain environments (Kubernetes for example) indirect calls to the LVM
      commands result in file descriptor leak warning messages which in turn cause
      the process_execution method to raise and exception.

      To accommodate these environments, and to maintain backward compatibility
      in Newton we add a ``lvm_suppress_fd_warnings`` bool config to the LVM driver.
      Setting this to True will append the LVM env vars to include the variable
      ``LVM_SUPPRESS_FD_WARNINGS=1``.

      This is made an optional configuration because it only applies to very specific
      environments.  If we were to make this global that would require a rootwrap/privsep
      update that could break compatibility when trying to do rolling upgrades of the
      volume service.
