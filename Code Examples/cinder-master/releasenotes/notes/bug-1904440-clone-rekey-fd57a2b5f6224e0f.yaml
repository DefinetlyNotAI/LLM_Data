    `Bug #1904440 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1904440>`_:
    When an iSCSI/FC encrypted volume was cloned, the rekey operation would
    stamp the wrong encryption key on the newly cloned volume.  This resulted
    in a volume that could not be attached.  It does not present a security
    problem.
