    Prior to the Ussuri release, ``os-reset_status`` notifications for
    volumes, snapshots, and backups were sent to *nonstandard* publisher_ids.
    This behavior was deprecated in Ussuri, and notifications were sent to
    both the standard and nonstandard publisher_ids.  In this release,
    ``os-reset_status`` notifications, like all other notifications for
    volume, snapshot and backup, are sent *only* to the following
    *standard* publisher_ids:

    * 'volume' for volume status resets
    * 'snapshot' for snapshot status resets
    * 'backup' for backup status resets
