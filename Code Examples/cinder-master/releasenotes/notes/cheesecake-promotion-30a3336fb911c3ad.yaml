    A new cinder-manage command, reset_active_backend, was added to promote a
    failed-over backend participating in replication.  This allows you to
    reset a backend without manually editing the database.  A backend
    undergoing promotion using this command is expected to be in a disabled
    and frozen state.  Support for both standalone and clustered backend
    configurations are supported.
