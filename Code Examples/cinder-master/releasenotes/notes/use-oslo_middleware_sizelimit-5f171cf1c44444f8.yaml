deprecations:
  - The api-paste.ini ``paste.filter_factory`` setting has been updated to use
    ``oslo_middleware.sizelimit`` rather than ``cinder.api.middleware.sizelimit``
    compatibility shim. ``cinder.api.middleware.sizelimit`` was deprecated in
    kilo and should now be updated to use ``oslo_middleware.sizelimit`` in
    api-paste.ini in preparation for removal in the pike release.
