    Cinder now stores the format of the backing file (raw or qcow2), for FS
    backends, in the volume admin metadata and includes the format in the
    connection_info returned in the Attachments API.
    Previously cinder tried to introspect the format, and under some
    circumstances, an incorrect format would be deduced. This will still be the
    case for legacy volumes. Explicitly storing the format will avoid this issue
    for newly created volumes.
