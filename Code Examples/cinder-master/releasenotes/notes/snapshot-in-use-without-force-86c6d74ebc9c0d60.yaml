    As of API version 3.66, volume snapshots of in-use volumes can be created
    without passing the 'force' flag, and the 'force' flag is considered
    invalid for this request.  For backward compatability, however, when the
    'force' flag is passed with a value evaluating to True, it is silently
    ignored.
