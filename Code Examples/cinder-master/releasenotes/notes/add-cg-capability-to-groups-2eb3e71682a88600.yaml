    Drivers supporting consistent group snapshot in generic volume groups
    reports "consistent_group_snapshot_enabled = True" instead of
    "consistencygroup_support = True". As a result, a spec such as
    "consistencygroup_support: '<is> True'" in either group type or
    volume type will cause the scheduler not to choose the backend
    that does not report "consistencygroup_support = True".

    In order to create a generic volume group that supports consistent
    group snapshot, "consistent_group_snapshot_enable: '<is> True'"
    should be set in the group type specs and volume type extra specs,
    and "consistencygroup_support: '<is> True'" should not be set
    in group type spec and volume type extra specs.
