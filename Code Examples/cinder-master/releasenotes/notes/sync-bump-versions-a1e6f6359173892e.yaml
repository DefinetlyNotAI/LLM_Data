features:
  - Cinder-manage DB sync command can now bump the RPC and Objects versions of
    the services to avoid a second restart when doing offline upgrades.
upgrade:
  - On offline upgrades, due to the rolling upgrade mechanism we need to
    restart the cinder services twice to complete the installation just like in
    the rolling upgrades case.  First you stop the cinder services, then you
    upgrade them, you sync your DB, then you start all the cinder services, and
    then you restart them all.  To avoid this last restart we can now instruct
    the DB sync to bump the services after the migration is completed, the
    command to do this is `cinder-manage db sync --bump-versions`
fixes:
  - After an offline upgrade we had to restart all Cinder services twice, now
    with the `cinder-manage db sync --bump-versions` command we can avoid the
    second restart.
