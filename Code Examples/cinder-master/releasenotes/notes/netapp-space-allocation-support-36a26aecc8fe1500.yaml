    NetApp iSCSI/FCP drivers: NetApp space allocation feature allows ONTAP
    and host to see the actual space correctly when host deletes data.
    It also notifies the host when the LUN cannot accept write data due
    to lack of space on the volume, and makes the LUN read-only
    (rather than going offline). This feature can be enabled or
    disabled on cinder volumes by using volume type extra specs with
    the ``netapp:space_allocation`` property.
