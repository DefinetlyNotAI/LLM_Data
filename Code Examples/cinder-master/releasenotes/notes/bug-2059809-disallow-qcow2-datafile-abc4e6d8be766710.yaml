    Images in the qcow2 format with an external data file are now
    rejected with an ``ImageUnacceptable`` error because such images
    could be used in an exploit to expose host information.  Given
    that qcow2 external data files were never supported by Cinder,
    this change should have no impact on users.  See `Bug #2059809
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/2059809>`_ for details.

    `Bug #2059809 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/2059809>`_:
    Fixed issue where a qcow2 format image with an external data file
    could expose host information.  Such an image is now rejected with
    an ``ImageUnacceptable`` error if it is used to create a volume.
    Given that  qcow2 external data files were never supported by
    Cinder, the only use for such an image previously was to attempt
    to steal host information, and hence this change should have no
    impact on users.
