    Fujitsu Eternus DX driver: Added cli operations when creating snapshot

    Fujitsu Eternus DX driver used to create snapshot using SMI-S, resulting
    in the inability to extend the source volume.

    To make the volume extendable after creating a snapshot, an additional
    parameter ``fujitsu_use_cli_copy`` is introduced with a default value of
    ``False``.

    * If ``fujitsu_use_cli_copy`` is set to ``False``, create a snapshot using
      the conventional SMI-S method.

    * If ``fujitsu_use_cli_copy`` is set to ``True``, create a snapshot using
      the CLI method, allowing volume extension of the source volume.

    Note that ``fujitsu_use_cli_copy`` cannot be set to True when the type of
    target pool is RAID Group.

    See the `Fujitsu ETERNUS DX driver documentation
    <https://docs.openstack.org/cinder/latest/configuration/block-storage/drivers/fujitsu-eternus-dx-driver.html>`_
    for details.
