    When managing volume types an OpenStack provider is now given more control to grant
    access to for different storage type operations. The provider can now customize access
    to type create, delete, update, list, and show using new entries in the cinder policy file.

    As an example one provider may have roles called viewer, admin, type_viewer, and say
    type_admin. Admin and type_admin can create, delete, update types. Everyone can list
    the storage types. Admin, type_viewer, and type_admin can view the extra_specs.

    "volume_extension:types_extra_specs:create": "rule:admin or rule:type_admin",
    "volume_extension:types_extra_specs:delete": "rule:admin or rule:type_admin",
    "volume_extension:types_extra_specs:index": "",
    "volume_extension:types_extra_specs:show": "rule:admin or rule:type_admin or rule:type_viewer",
    "volume_extension:types_extra_specs:update": "rule:admin or rule:type_admin"
