features:
  - The ``force`` boolean parameter has been added to the volume
    delete API.  It may be used in combination with ``cascade``.
    This also means that volume force delete is available
    in the base volume API rather than only in the
    ``volume_admin_actions`` extension.
upgrade:
  - There is a new policy option ``volume:force_delete`` which
    controls access to the ability to specify force delete
    via the volume delete API.  This is separate from the
    pre-existing ``volume-admin-actions:force_delete`` policy
    check.
