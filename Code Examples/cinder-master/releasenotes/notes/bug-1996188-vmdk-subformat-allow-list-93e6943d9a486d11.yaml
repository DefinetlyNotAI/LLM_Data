    This release introduces a new configuration option,
    ``vmdk_allowed_types``, that specifies the list of VMDK image
    subformats that Cinder will allow.  The default setting allows
    only the 'streamOptimized' and 'monolithicSparse' subformats,
    which do not use named extents.

    This release introduces a new configuration option,
    ``vmdk_allowed_types``, that specifies the list of VMDK image
    subformats that Cinder will allow in order to prevent exposure
    of host information by modifying the named extents in a VMDK
    image.  The default setting allows only the 'streamOptimized'
    and 'monolithicSparse' subformats, which do not use named extents.

    As part of the fix for `Bug #1996188
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1996188>`_, cinder is now more
    strict in checking that the ``disk_format`` recorded for an image (as
    revealed by the Image Service API image-show response) matches what
    cinder detects when it downloads the image.  Thus, some requests to
    create a volume from a source image that had previously succeeded may
    fail with an ``ImageUnacceptable`` error.

    `Bug #1996188 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1996188>`_:
    Fixed issue where a VMDK image file whose createType allowed named
    extents could expose host information.  This change introduces a new
    configuration option, ``vmdk_allowed_types``, that specifies the list
    of VMDK image subformats that Cinder will allow.  The default
    setting allows only the 'streamOptimized' and 'monolithicSparse'
    subformats.
