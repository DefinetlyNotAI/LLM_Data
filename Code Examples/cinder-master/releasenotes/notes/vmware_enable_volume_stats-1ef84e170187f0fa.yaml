    VMware vmdk driver: The vmware vmdk driver had its get_volume_stats
    removed in a previous release due to a potential performance hit of 20%
    at a high load.  The problem with reporting ``unknown`` back to the
    scheduler, is that it effectively removes cinder's ability to properly
    schedule based on capacity utilization.  When this driver is enabled in a
    heterogenous environment without properly reporting utilization
    statistics, the scheduler's capacity filter will always allow this driver
    to service a provisioning request. Without reporting the backend stats,
    the capacity filter also can't determine the reserved_percentage as well
    as the max_over_subscription_ratio. To enable the collection of stats
    set ``vmware_enable_volume_stats`` to True in the driver section of
    cinder.conf.  The default setting is False.  Keep in mind that there may
    be a degradation in performance on the vcenter when enabling this setting.

    VMware vmdk driver: The collection of volume stats, which had been
    disabled, may now be turned on by using the ``vmware_enable_volume_stats``
    configuration option.  The default for this option is False (no
    stats collection).  Be aware that enabling volume stats may cause
    performance issues under high load.
