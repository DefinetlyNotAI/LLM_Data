    `Bug #1980268 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1980268>`_:
    When creating a volume from an image, a check has been added to compare
    the requested volume size to the image's ``virtual_size`` property and
    fail the request if the volume will be too small to contain the image.
    If the image record does not contain this property, the request is
    accepted but the volume will go to ``error`` status if the image does
    not fit (which is the current behavior).
