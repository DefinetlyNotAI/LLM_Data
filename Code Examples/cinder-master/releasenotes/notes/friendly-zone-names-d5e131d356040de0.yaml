  - Cinder FC Zone Manager Friendly Zone Names
    This feature adds support for Fibre Channel user
    friendly zone names if implemented by the volume driver.
    If the volume driver passes the host name and
    storage system to the Fibre Channel Zone Manager
    in the conn_info structure, the zone manager
    will use these names in structuring the zone
    name to provide a user friendly zone name.
