    NetApp drivers: NFS, iSCSI and FCP drivers have now the option to request
    ONTAP operations through REST API. The new option `netapp_use_legacy_client`
    switches between the old ZAPI client approach and new REST client. It is
    default to `True`, meaning that the drivers will keep working as before
    using ZAPI operations. If desired, this option can be set to `False` interacting
    with  the storage using the new REST client. However, this new client still
    relies on ZAPI calls for consistency group snapshot operation.

    The drivers can only be configured with REST client when using ONTAP storage
    9.11.1 or newer.

    NOTE: Enabling ONTAP REST client changes the behavior of QoS specs. Earlier,
    QoS values could be represented in BPS (bytes per second), but now REST client
    only supports integer values represented in MBPS (Megabytes per second).
    It means that though the user specifies the value in BPS, it will be converted
    to MBPS and rounded up.
