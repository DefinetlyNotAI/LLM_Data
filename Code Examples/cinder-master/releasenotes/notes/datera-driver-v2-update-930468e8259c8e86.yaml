features:
  - All Datera DataFabric backed volume-types will now use
    API version 2 with Datera DataFabric.
upgrade:
  - Users of the Datera Cinder driver are now required to use
    Datera DataFabric version 1.0+. Versions before 1.0 will
    not be able to utilize this new driver since they still
    function on v1 of the Datera DataFabric API.
deprecations:
  - Config option ``datera_api_token`` has been replaced by
    options ``san_login`` and ``san_password``.
