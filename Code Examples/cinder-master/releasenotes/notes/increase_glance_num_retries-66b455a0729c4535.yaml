    The default value of the configuration option, ``glance_num_retries``,
    has been changed to 3 in this release. Its former value was 0.
    The option controls how many times to retry a Glance API call
    in response to a HTTP connection failure, timeout or ServiceUnavailable status.
    By this change, Cinder can be more resilient to temporary failure and continue
    the request if a retry succeeds.
