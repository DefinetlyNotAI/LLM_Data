features:
  - Google backup driver now supports ``google-auth`` library, and is the
    preferred library if both ``google-auth`` (together with
    ``google-auth-httplib2``) and ``oauth2client`` libraries are present in the
    system.
deprecations:
  - Cinder's Google backup driver is now called gcs, so ``backup_driver``
    configuration for Google Cloud Storage should be updated from
    ``cinder.backup.drivers.google`` to ``cinder.backup.driver.gcs``.
fixes:
  - Google backup driver now works when using ``google-api-python-client``
    version 1.6.0 or higher.
