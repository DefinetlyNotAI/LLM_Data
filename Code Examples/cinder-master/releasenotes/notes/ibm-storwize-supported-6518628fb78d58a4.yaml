    IBM Spectrum Virtualize Family (previously known as Storwize) drivers
    had been previously marked unsupported. Testing requirements have been
    addressed and they are now fully supported again. IBM Spectrum Virtualize
    Family drivers allow Cinder to manage volumes both in iSCSI and FC
    environments.
