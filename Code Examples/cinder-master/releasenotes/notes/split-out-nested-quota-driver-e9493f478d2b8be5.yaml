features:
  - Split nested quota support into a separate driver. In
    order to use nested quotas, change the following config
    ``quota_driver = cinder.quota.NestedDbQuotaDriver`` after
    running the following admin API
    "os-quota-sets/validate_setup_for_nested_quota_use" command
    to ensure the existing quota values make sense to nest.
upgrade:
  - Nested quotas will no longer be used by default, but can be
    configured by setting
    ``quota_driver = cinder.quota.NestedDbQuotaDriver``
