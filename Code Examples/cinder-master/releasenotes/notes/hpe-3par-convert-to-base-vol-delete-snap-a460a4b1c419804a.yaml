    HPE 3PAR driver `Bug #1994521 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1994521>`_:
    Fixed: While performing a delete snapshot (s1) operation, the volumes (v2)
    dependent on the snapshot (s1) are converted to base volumes. This
    operation fails if these dependent volumes (v2) have their own dependent
    snapshots (s2). The errors during the failure were vague and not helpful.
    With this release, we added conditions to fail this operation early and
    also added useful error message.
