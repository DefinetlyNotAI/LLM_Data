    Cinder stopped supporting single-backend configurations in Ocata. However,
    sample ``cinder.conf`` was still generated with driver-related options in
    ``[DEFAULT]`` section, where those options had no effect at all. Now all of
    driver options are listed in ``[backend_defaults]`` section, that indicates
    that those options are effective only in this section and
    ``[<backend_name>]`` sections listed in ``enabled_backends``.
