    PowerFlex Driver `bug #2052995
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/2052995>`_: REST
    API calls to the PowerFlex backend did not have a timeout
    set, which could result in cinder waiting forever.
    This fix introduces two configuration options,
    ``rest_api_connect_timeout`` and ``rest_api_read_timeout``,
    to control timeouts when connecting to the backend.
    The default value of each is 30 seconds.
