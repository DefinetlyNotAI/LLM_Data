    Dell PowerFlex driver `bug #1998136
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1998136>`_:
    When using self signed certificates, the option
    sent to os-brick via the connection_properties was
    not correctly handled. It has now been fixed by
    adding the 'verify_certificate' and 'certificate_path'
    to the driver when initializing the connection.
