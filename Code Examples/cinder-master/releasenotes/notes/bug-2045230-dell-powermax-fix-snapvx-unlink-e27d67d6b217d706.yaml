    Dell PowerMax Driver `Bug #2045230
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/2045230>`_: Fixed
    the issue that Dell PowerMax SnapVx link fails as the linked device is not
    yet fully defined.

    Previously, the below operations could fail if the linked device was not
    yet fully defined at the time of the call.
    Now, when ``snapvx_unlink_symforce`` is enabled, those operations are not
    interrupted by not fully defined devices.

    By default, ``snapvx_unlink_symforce`` is ``False``. Use extreme caution
    with this option. If used when a link is copy in progress or when a restore
    is restore in progress, this will cause an incomplete copy and data on the
    copy target would not be usable.

    Impacted operations:

    * Clone a volume
    * Create a volume from a snapshot
    * Create volume snapshots
    * Delete volume snapshots
    * Revert volume to snapshot
    * Create generic volume group from source
    * Unmanage volumes

    Dell PowerMax Driver: introduced a new configuration option,
    ``snapvx_unlink_symforce``, to address Bug #2045230.  See the Bug Fixes
    section for details.
