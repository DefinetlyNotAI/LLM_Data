upgrade:
  - |
    A new check is added to the ``cinder-status upgrade check`` CLI to check
    for the use of the deprecated ``cinder.quota.NestedDbQuotaDriver``. This
    driver will be replaced by a new, OpenStack-wide, nested quota management.
deprecations:
  - |
    The ``cinder.quota.NestedDbQuotaDriver`` quota driver for handling nested
    projects is now deprecated. There is an OpenStack-wide effort to move to
    "unified limits" that will require changes in how quotas are handled for
    these types of configurations. The ``NestedDbQuotaDriver`` will continue
    to work until it is replaced with this new mechanism.
