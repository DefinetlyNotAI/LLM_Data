    Dell PowerStore Driver `bug #2055022
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/2055022>`_: REST
    API calls to the PowerStore backend did not have a timeout
    set, which could result in cinder waiting forever.
    This fix introduces two configuration options,
    ``rest_api_call_connect_timeout`` and
    ``rest_api_call_read_timeout``, to control timeouts
    when connecting to the backend.
    The default value of each is 30 seconds.
