    RBD driver `bug #1960206
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1960206>`_: Fixed
    ``total_capacity`` reported by the driver to the scheduler on Ceph clusters
    that have renamed the ``bytes_used`` field to ``stored``. (e.g., `Nautilus
    <https://docs.ceph.com/en/nautilus/releases/nautilus/#upgrade-compatibility-notes>`_).
