    Fujitsu ETERNUS DX driver: Added support to extend a volume on RAID Group
    using CLI.

    Revised the 'Extend Volume' process on the RAID Group to improve processing
    speed as follows:

    * When extending a volume created on ThinProvisionPool, the process will
      still use SMI-S for volume extension.

    * When extending a volume created on RaidGroup, the process has been
      updated to use CLI for volume extension.
