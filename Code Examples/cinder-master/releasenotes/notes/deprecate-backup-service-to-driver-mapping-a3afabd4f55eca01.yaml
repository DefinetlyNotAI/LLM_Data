deprecations:
  - |
    Backup service to driver mapping is deprecated. If you use old values
    like 'cinder.backup.services.swift' or 'cinder.backup.services.ceph'
    it should be changed to 'cinder.backup.drivers.swift' or
    'cinder.backup.drivers.ceph' accordingly to get your backup service
    working in the 'R' release.
