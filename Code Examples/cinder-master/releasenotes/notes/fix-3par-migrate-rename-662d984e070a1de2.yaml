    `Bug #1858119 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1858119>`_:
    Fix the HPE 3PAR driver's attempt to rename the backend volume after
    it was migrated. If the original volume resides on the same 3PAR backend
    then the pre and post migration volume names are swapped. Otherwise, the
    newly migrated volume is renamed to match the original name.
