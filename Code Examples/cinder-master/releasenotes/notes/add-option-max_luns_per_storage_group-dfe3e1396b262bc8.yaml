deprecations:
  - |
    Deprecate option `check_max_pool_luns_threshold`. The VNX driver will
    always check the threshold.
fixes:
  - |
    Add option `max_luns_per_storage_group` back. The max LUNs per storage
    group was set to 255 before. With the new option, admin can set it to a
    larger number.
