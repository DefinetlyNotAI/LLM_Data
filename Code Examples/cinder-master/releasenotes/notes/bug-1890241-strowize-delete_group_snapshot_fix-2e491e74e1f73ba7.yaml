    `Bug #1890241 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1890241>`_:
    During delete_group_snapshot on IBM storwize, in case of multiple
    snapshots in the group, delete flow exits if any one snapshot deletion
    fails, but it should update error state and continue with deleting
    other snapshots.
