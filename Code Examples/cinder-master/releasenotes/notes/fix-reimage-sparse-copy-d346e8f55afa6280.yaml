    `Bug #2045431 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/2045431>`_: Fixed
    a data leak scenario where we preserve sparseness when reimaging the
    volume.

    We currently do a sparse copy when writing an image on the volume. This
    could be a potential data leak scenario where the zero blocks of the new
    image are not written on the existing volume and the data from the old
    image still exists on the volume. We fix the scenario by not doing sparse
    copy when reimaging the volume.
