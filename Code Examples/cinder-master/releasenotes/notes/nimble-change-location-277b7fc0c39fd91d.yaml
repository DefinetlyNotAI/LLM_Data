    The Nimble Storage became a part of the HPE family of Storage solutions.
    The cinder Nimble driver has been relocated to the
    ``cinder.volume.driver.hpe`` module to reflect this.
    The impact on operators is that the module path
    ``cinder.volume.drivers.nimble.NimbleISCSIDriver`` and
    ``cinder.volume.drivers.nimble.FCDriver`` should now be updated to
    ``cinder.volume.drivers.hpe.nimble.NimbleISCSIDriver`` and
    ``cinder.volume.drivers.hpe.nimble.NimbleFCDriver`` respectively in
    ``cinder.conf``
