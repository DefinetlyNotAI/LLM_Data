    LUKS Encrypted RBD volumes can now be created by cinder-volume. This
    capability was previously blocked by the rbd volume driver due to the lack
    of any encryptors capable of attaching to an encrypted RBD volume. These
    volumes can also be seeded with RAW image data from Glance through the use
    of QEMU 2.10 and the qemu-img convert command.
