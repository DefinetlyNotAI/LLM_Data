    The ``cinder-manage db sync`` command for this verison of cinder will add
    additional database indexes.  Depending on database size and complexity,
    this will take time to complete for every single index to be created. On
    MySQL or MariaDB, these indexes will only be created if an index does not
    already exist with the same name:

    * ``groups_deleted_project_id_idx``
    * ``group_snapshots_deleted_project_id_idx``
    * ``volumes_deleted_project_id_idx``
    * ``volumes_deleted_host_idx``
    * ``snapshots_deleted_project_id_idx``
    * ``backups_deleted_project_id_idx``

    An example of the SQL commands to generate these indexes can be found
    in the `specific troubleshooting guide
    <htts://docs.openstack.org/cinder/latest/admin/ts-db-cpu-spikes.html>`_.
