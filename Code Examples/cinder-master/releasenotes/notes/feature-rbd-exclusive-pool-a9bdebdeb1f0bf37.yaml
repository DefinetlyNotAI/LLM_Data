    When using the RBD pool exclusively for Cinder we can now set
    `rbd_exclusive_cinder_pool` to `true` and Cinder will use DB information
    to calculate provisioned size instead of querying all volumes in the
    backend, which will reduce the load on the Ceph cluster and the volume
    service.

    If RBD stats collection is taking too long in your environment maybe even
    leading to the service appearing as down you'll want to use the
    `rbd_exclusive_cinder_pool = true` configuration option if you are using
    the pool exclusively for Cinder and maybe even if you are not and can live
    with the innacuracy.
