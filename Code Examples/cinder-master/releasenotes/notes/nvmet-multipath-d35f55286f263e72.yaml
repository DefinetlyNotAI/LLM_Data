features:
  - |
    nvmet target driver: Added support to serve volumes on multiple addresses
    using the ``target_secondary_ip_addresses`` configuration option. This
    allows os-brick to iterate through them in search of one connection that
    works, and once os-brick supports NVMe-oF multipathing it will be
    automatically supported.

    This requires that ``nvmeof_conn_info_version`` configuration option is set
    to ``2`` as well.
deprecations:
  - |
    Configuration option ``iscsi_secondary_ip_addresses`` is deprecated in
    favor of ``target_secondary_ip_addresses`` to follow the same naming
    convention of ``target_ip_address``.
