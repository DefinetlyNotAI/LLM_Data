    Starting with API microversion 3.70, encrypted volumes can be transferred
    to a user in a different project. Prior to microversion 3.70, the transfer
    is blocked due to the inability to transfer ownership of the volume's
    encryption key. With microverson 3.70, ownership of the encryption key is
    transferred when the volume is transferred.
