    If you have ``backup_driver_status_check_interval`` option in your
    cinder.conf we recommend you to use ``backup_driver_stats_polling_interval``
    to avoid deprecation warnings in logs.

    ``backup_driver_status_check_interval`` config option is renamed to
    ``backup_driver_stats_polling_interval`` to be similar with volume drivers
    configuration. Old option name support will be dropped in U release.
