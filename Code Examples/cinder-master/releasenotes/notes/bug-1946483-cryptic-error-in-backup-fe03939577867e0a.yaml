    `Bug #1946483 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1946483>`_: Fixed
    an issue where admin user fails to delete backup of an encrypted
    volume with an ``oslo_config.cfg.NoSuchOptError`` error in logs
    of cinder-backup service.
    With this fix cloud admin is able to delete backups of encrypted volumes
    created by other users if Barbican API policies allow it.
