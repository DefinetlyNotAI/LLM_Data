    `Bug #2008259 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/2008259>`_:
    Fixed the volume create functionality where non-admin users were
    able to create multiattach volumes by providing the `multiattach`
    parameter in the request body. Now we can only create multiattach
    volumes using a multiattach volume type, which is also the
    recommended way.

    Removed the ability to create multiattach volumes by specifying
    `multiattach` parameter in the request body of a volume create
    operation. This functionality is unsafe, can lead to data loss,
    and has been deprecated since the Queens release.
    The recommended method for creating a multiattach volume is to
    use a volume type that supports multiattach.  By default, volume
    types can only be created by the operator.  Users who have a need
    for multiattach volumes should contact their operator if a suitable
    volume type is not available.
