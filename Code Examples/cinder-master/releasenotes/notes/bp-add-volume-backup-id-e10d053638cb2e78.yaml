    Added the property ``src_backup_id`` to the volume's metadata,
    to record from which backup the new volume was created.
    If the ``src_backup_id`` exists in the volume's metadata, it will be updated.
    When restoring from a chain of incremental backups, ``src_backup_id``
    is set to the last incremental backup used for the restore.
