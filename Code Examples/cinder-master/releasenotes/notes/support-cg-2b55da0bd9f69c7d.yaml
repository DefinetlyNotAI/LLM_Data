    Dell EMC Unity driver: Add consistent group support. Users could create a
    group type supporting consistent groups with specification
    `'consistent_group_snapshot_enabled': <is> True`, then any groups created
    of that group type are consistent groups, otherwise they are generic
    groups. The supported operations are: create/delete consistent groups, add
    volumes to and remove volumes from consistent groups, create/delete
    consistent group snapshots, create consistent groups from snapshots, clone
    consistent groups.
