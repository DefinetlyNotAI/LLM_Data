    Fix the way encryption key IDs are managed for encrypted volume backups.
    When creating a backup, the volume's encryption key is cloned and assigned
    a new key ID. The backup's cloned key ID is now stored in the backup
    database so that it can be deleted whenever the backup is deleted.

    When restoring the backup of an encrypted volume, the destination volume
    is assigned a clone of the backup's encryption key ID. This ensures every
    restored backup has a unique encryption key ID, even when multiple volumes
    have been restored from the same backup.
