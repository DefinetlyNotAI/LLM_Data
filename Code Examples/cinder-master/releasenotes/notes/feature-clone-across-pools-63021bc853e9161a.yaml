features:
  - Add the clone_across_pools driver capability

    Drivers can now declare that they can clone a volume into a
    different pool. Essentially, if this capability is declared, Cinder
    will skip the check that the pool of the destination volume is the
    same as the pool of the source volume.

    Some drivers do not have such a restriction and it may be possible
    to complete the "create volume from image" operation very
    efficiently instead of falling back to the "attach and dd" option.

    This affects creating a volume from an image with and without the
    image cache. For more details please check `bp clone_across_pools
    <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/cinder/+spec/clone-across-pools>`__
