    Add ability to extend ``in-use`` volume. User should be aware of the
    whole environment before using this feature because it's dependent
    on several external factors below:

    * nova-compute version - needs to be the latest for Pike.
    * only the libvirt compute driver supports this currently.
    * only iscsi and fibre channel volume types are supported on the nova side currently.

    Administrator can disable this ability by updating the
    ``volume:extend_attached_volume`` policy rule.
