    StorPool driver `bug #2002995
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/2002995>`_: When retyping a
    volume on a StorPool backend to a different volume type also on that
    StorPool backend but using a different StorPool template, occasionally
    the retype operation would fail or the old volume could be left attached
    to a StorPool client. This issue has been fixed in this release.
