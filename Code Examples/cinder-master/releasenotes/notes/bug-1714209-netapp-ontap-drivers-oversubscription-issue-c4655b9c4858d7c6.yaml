fixes:
  - The ONTAP drivers ("7mode" and "cmode") have been fixed to not report
    consumed space as "provisioned_capacity_gb". They instead rely on
    the cinder scheduler's calculation of "provisioned_capacity_gb". This
    fixes the oversubscription miscalculations with the ONTAP drivers. This
    bugfix affects all three protocols supported by these drivers
    (iSCSI/FC/NFS).
upgrade:
  - If using the NetApp ONTAP drivers (7mode/cmode), the configuration value
    for "max_over_subscription_ratio" may need to be increased to
    avoid scheduling problems where storage pools that previously were
    valid to schedule new volumes suddenly appear to be out of space
    to the Cinder scheduler. See
    documentation `here <https://docs.openstack
    .org/cinder/latest/admin/blockstorage-over-subscription.html>`_.
