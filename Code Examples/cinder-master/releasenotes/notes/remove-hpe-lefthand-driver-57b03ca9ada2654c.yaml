    The HPE Lefthand Driver (iSCSI) was marked unsupported in the
    Train release as the StoreVirtual product line has gone EOL and
    the LeftHand OS no longer receives upgrades.  The driver has been
    removed in this release.  All data on backends powered by HPE
    LeftHand OS should be migrated to a supported storage backend
    before upgrading your Cinder installation.
