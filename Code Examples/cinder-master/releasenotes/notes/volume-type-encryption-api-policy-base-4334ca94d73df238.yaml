    The ``volume_extension:volume_type_encryption`` policy, which was
    deprecated in Stein, has been un-deprecated for the convenience of
    operators who would like to set the policies for the create, get,
    update, and delete operations for a volume type's encryption type
    in one place.  The default value for this policy target has not
    changed.

    As a reminder, the finer-grained policies are:

    - ``volume_extension:volume_type_encryption:create``
    - ``volume_extension:volume_type_encryption:get``
    - ``volume_extension:volume_type_encryption:update``
    - ``volume_extension:volume_type_encryption:delete``

    The default values for these policies have also not changed.  See
    the `sample Cinder policy file
    <https://docs.openstack.org/cinder/ussuri/configuration/block-storage/samples/policy.yaml.html>`_
    for more information.
