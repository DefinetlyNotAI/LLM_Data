    Volume "force delete" was introduced with the 3.23 API microversion,
    however the check for in the service was incorrectly looking for
    microversion 3.2. That check has now been fixed. It is possible that an API
    call using a microversion below 3.23 would previously work for this call,
    which will now fail. This closes
    `bug #1783028 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1783028>`_.
