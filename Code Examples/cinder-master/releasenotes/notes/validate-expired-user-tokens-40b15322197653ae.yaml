    Added support for Keystone middleware feature to pass service token along with
    the user token for Cinder to Nova and Glance services. This will help get rid
    of user token expiration issues during long running tasks e.g. creating volume
    snapshot (Cinder->Nova) and creating volume from image (Cinder->Glance) etc.
    To use this functionality a service user needs to be created first. Add the
    service user configurations in ``cinder.conf`` under ``service_user`` group
    and set ``send_service_user_token`` flag to ``True``.
