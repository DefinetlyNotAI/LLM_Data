    Now availability zone is supported in volume type as below.

    * ``RESKEY:availability_zones`` now is a reserved spec key for AZ volume type,
      and administrator can create AZ volume type that includes AZ restrictions
      by adding a list of Az's to the extra specs similar to:
      ``RESKEY:availability_zones: az1,az2``.
    * Extra spec ``RESKEY:availability_zones`` will only be used for filtering backends
      when creating and retyping volumes.
    * Volume type can be filtered within extra spec: /types?extra_specs={"key":"value"}
      since microversion "3.52".
