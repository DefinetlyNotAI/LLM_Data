    RBD driver: support added for reverting a volume to the most recent
    snapshot taken.

    Please be aware of the following known issues with this operation
    and the Ceph storage backend:

    * Rolling back a volume to a snapshot overwrites the current volume
      with the data from the snapshot, and the time it takes to complete
      this operation increases with the size of the volume.

      It is faster to create a new volume from a snapshot.  You may
      wish to recommend this option to your users whose use cases do not
      strictly require revert-to-snapshot.

    * The efficiency of revert-to-snapshot is also dependent upon the
      Ceph storage backend in use, namely, whether or not BlueStore is
      being used in your Ceph installation.

    Please consult the Ceph documentation for details.
