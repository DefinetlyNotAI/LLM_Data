    `Bug #1945500 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1945500>`_: The
    original attempt at fixing this bug did not account for differences in
    how glance and cinder store image metadata, and as a result some image
    properties were not filtered out. This new improved fix addresses those
    differences and makes the filtering more thorough.
