    For the convenience of operators, the `unsupported driver removal policy
    <https://docs.openstack.org/cinder/ussuri/drivers-all-about.html#driver-removal>`_
    was changed during the Ussuri development cycle to allow unsupported
    drivers to remain in the Cinder source code repository at the discretion
    of the Cinder team (basically, this means the vendor has not explicitly
    declared the driver EOL or the vendor has expressed interest in getting
    the third-party CI system working again).  Be aware, however, that
    such drivers are subject to immediate removal if they begin failing
    the general Cinder gating tests.

    The following drivers were classified as unsupported in the Train
    release and continue as unspported in this release:

    - IBM FlashSystem drivers: FC and iSCSI
    - ProphetStor drivers: FC and iSCSI
    - Veritas ACCESS iSCSI driver
    - Virtuozzo Storage driver

    For completeness, here is the list of drivers first marked unsupported
    in the Ussuri release.  See the "Deprecation Notes" section of this
    document for details.

    - Brocade Fibre Channel Zone Manager driver
    - MacroSAN drivers: FC and iSCSI
    - Veritas Clustered NFS driver

    In order to use an unsupported driver, ``enable_unsupported_driver`` must
    be set to ``True`` in the driver's section in the cinder.conf file.  If
    you are the consumer of such a driver, we encourage you to contact the
    vendor to make them aware of your concerns.

    A key aspect of *supported* drivers is that there is a fully functioning
    third-party CI system that reports on all proposed changes to the cinder
    code.  However, the fact that there are 'unsupported' drivers at all
    indicates that third-party CI systems are unfortunately not always
    fully functioning.  You may consult the report at the following link
    to learn the extent to which a particular driver's CI system is reporting
    on the development branch of cinder:
