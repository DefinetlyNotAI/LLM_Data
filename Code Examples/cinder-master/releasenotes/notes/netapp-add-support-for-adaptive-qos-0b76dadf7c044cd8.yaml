    NetApp ONTAP:
    Added support for Adaptive QoS policies that have been pre-created on
    the storage system, with the NetApp driver and clustered ONTAP version
    9.4 or higher.  To use this feature, configure a Cinder volume type with
    the following extra-specs::

        netapp:qos_policy_group=<name_of_precreated_aqos_policy>
        netapp:qos_policy_group_is_adaptive="<is> True"

    Note that a cluster scoped account must be used in the driver
    configuration in order to use QoS in clustered ONTAP.
