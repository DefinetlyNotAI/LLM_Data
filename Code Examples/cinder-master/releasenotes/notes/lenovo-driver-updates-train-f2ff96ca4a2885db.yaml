upgrade:
  - |
    The Lenovo driver options ``lenovo_backend_name`` and ``lenovo_backend_type``
    options were deprecated in favor of ``lenovo_pool_name`` and
    ``lenovo_pool_type`` to avoid confusion, and the
    ``lenovo_api_protocol``, ``lenovo_verify_certificate``, and
    ``lenovo_verify_certificate_path`` options were deprecated in favor of
    the standard ``driver_use_ssl``, ``driver_ssl_cert_verify``, and
    ``driver_ssl_cert_path`` options.  To retain the default behavior, add
    ``driver_use_ssl = true`` to back-end entries in ``cinder.conf``
    before the deprecated options are removed in a future release.
