    Cinder now support policy in code, which means if users don't need to
    modify any of the default policy rules, they do not need a policy file.
    Users can modify/generate a `policy.yaml` file which will override specific
    policy rules from their defaults.

    Default `policy.json` file is now removed as Cinder now uses default
    policies. A policy file is only needed if overriding one of the defaults.
