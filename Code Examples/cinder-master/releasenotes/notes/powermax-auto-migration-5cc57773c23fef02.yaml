    This PowerMax driver moves the legacy shared volume from the masking
    view structure in Ocata and prior releases (when SMI-S was supported) to
    staging masking view(s) in Pike and later releases (U4P REST).
    In Ocata, the live migration process shared the storage group,
    containing the volume, among the different compute nodes. In Pike,
    we changed the masking view structure to facilitate a cleaner live
    migration process where only the intended volume is migrated without
    exposing other volumes in the storage group. The staging storage group
    and masking views facilitate a seamless live migration operation in
    upgraded releases.
