    `Bug #1979666 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1979666>`_:
    PowerMax driver : Fixed rare case where the SRP in the local and
    remote arrays are different when managing volumes into OpenStack.
    For backward compatibility and name matching, the default storage
    group will assume the SRP name of the local array on both arrays.
