features:
  - Added image signature verification support when creating volume
    from image. This depends on signature metadata from glance.
    This feature is turned on by default, administrators can
    change behaviour by updating option ``verify_glance_signatures``.
    Also, an additional image metadata ``signature_verified`` has
    been added to indicate whether signature verification was performed
    during creating process.
