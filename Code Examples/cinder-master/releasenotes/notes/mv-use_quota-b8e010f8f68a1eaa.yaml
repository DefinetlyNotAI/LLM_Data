    Starting with API microversion 3.65, a ``consumes_quota`` field
    is included in the response body of volumes and snapshots to indicate
    whether the volume is using quota or not.

    Additionally, ``consumes_quota`` can be used as a listing filter for
    volumes and snapshots.  Its availability is controlled by its inclusion in
    ``etc/cinder/resource_filters.json``, where it is included by default.  The
    default listing behavior is not to use this filter.

    Only temporary resources created internally by cinder will have the value
    set to ``false``.
