    Added the option ``storwize_svc_retain_aux_volume`` to IBM Storwize Driver
    which takes ``True`` or ``False``. This option is to enable or disable
    retaining of auxiliary volume on secondary storage during delete of the
    volume on primary storage or moving the primary volume from mirror to
    non-mirror with replication enabled. The default value is ``False``.
