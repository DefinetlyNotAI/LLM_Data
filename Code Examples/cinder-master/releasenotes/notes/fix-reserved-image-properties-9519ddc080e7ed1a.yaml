    We introduced a new config parameter, ``reserved_image_namespaces``,
    that allows operators to set the image properties to filter out from
    volume image metadata by namespace when uploading a volume to Glance.
    These properties, if not filtered out, cause failures when uploading
    images back to Glance. The error will happen on Glance side when the
    reserved namespaces are used. This option is also useful when an operator
    wants to use the Glance property protections feature to make some image
    properties read-only.

    `Bug #1945500 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1945500>`_: Fixed
    an error when uploading to Glance a previously downloaded glance image
    when glance multistore is enabled. Glance reserves image properties
    in the namespace 'os_glance' for its own use and will not allow
    images to be created with these properties. Additionally, there are image
    properties, such as those associated with image signature verification,
    that are stored in a volume's image metadata, which should not be added
    to a new image when a volume is being uploaded as an image. Thus Cinder
    will no longer include any volume image metadata in the namespaces
    ``os_glance`` and ``img_signature`` when it creates an image in Glance.
    Furthermore, because the Glance property protections feature allows an
    operator to configure specific image properties as read-only, this fix
    adds a configuration option, ``reserved_image_namespaces``, that allows an
    operator to exclude additional image properties by namespace (the
    ``os_glance`` and ``img_signature`` namespaces are *always* excluded).
