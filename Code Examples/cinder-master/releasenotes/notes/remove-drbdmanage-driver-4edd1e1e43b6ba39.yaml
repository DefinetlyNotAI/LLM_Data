upgrade:
  - The DRBDManage driver is now removed.  Customers using the
    DRBDManage driver should not upgrade Cinder without first
    migrating all volumes from their DRBDManage backend to a
    supported storage backend such as LINSTOR.  Failure to migrate
    volumes will result in not being able to access volumes backed
    by the DRBDManage storage backend.
deprecations:
  - The DRBDManage driver is deprecated as of the Stein release and
    is removed in the Train release.  Users should use the new
    LINSTOR driver instead.
