    IBM Spectrum Virtualize Family `Bug #1896214
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1896214>`_:
    Fixed issues in change_vdisk_iogrp.
    During retyping a volume between I/O groups, if addvdiskaccess fails
    an exception is raised and if movevdisk fails rmvdiskaccess should be
    done for new I/O group before failing the retype operation.
