issues:
  - Cinder services are now automatically downgrading RPC
    messages to be understood by the oldest version of a
    service among all the deployment. Disabled and dead
    services are also taken into account. It is important to
    keep service list up to date, without old, unused
    records. This can be done using ``cinder-manage service
    remove`` command. Once situation is cleaned up services
    should be either restarted or ``SIGHUP`` signal should
    be issued to their processes to force them to reload
    version pins.  Please note that cinder-api does not
    support ``SIGHUP`` signal.
upgrade:
  - If during a *live* upgrade from Liberty a backup service
    will be killed while processing a restore request it may
    happen that such backup status won't be automatically
    cleaned up on the service restart. Such orphaned backups
    need to be cleaned up manually.
  - When performing a *live* upgrade from Liberty it may
    happen that retype calls will reserve additional quota.
    As by default quota reservations are invalidated after
    24 hours (config option ``reservation_expire=86400``),
    we recommend either decreasing that time or watching for
    unused quota reservations manually during the upgrade
    process.
