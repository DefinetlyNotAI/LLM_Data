features:
  - |
    RBD driver supports returning a static total capacity value instead of a
    dynamic value like it's been doing.  Configurable with
    `report_dynamic_total_capacity` configuration option.
upgrade:
  - |
    RBD/Ceph backends should adjust `max_over_subscription_ratio` to take into
    account that the driver is no longer reporting volume's physical usage but
    it's provisioned size.
fixes:
  - |
    RBD stats report has been fixed, now properly reports
    `allocated_capacity_gb` and `provisioned_capacity_gb` with the sum of the
    sizes of the volumes (not physical sizes) for volumes created by Cinder and
    all available in the pool respectively.  Free capacity will now properly
    handle quota size restrictions of the pool.
