    Nimble driver `bug #1918229
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1918229>`_: Corrected an issue
    where the Nimble storage driver was inaccurately determining that there
    was no free space left in the storage array. The driver now relies on the
    storage array to report the amount of free space.
