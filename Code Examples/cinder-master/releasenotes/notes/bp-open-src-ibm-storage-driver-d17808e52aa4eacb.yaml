features:

    The IBM_Storage driver has been open sourced. This means that there is no
    more need to download the package from the IBM site. The only requirement
    remaining is to install pyxcli, which is available through pypi::

        ``sudo pip install pyxcli``

upgrade:
  - |
    Previous installations of IBM Storage must be un-installed first and the
    new driver should be installed on top. In addition the cinder.conf values
    should be updated to reflect the new paths. For example the proxy setting
    of ``storage.proxy.IBMStorageProxy`` should be updated to
    ``cinder.volume.drivers.ibm.ibm_storage.proxy.IBMStorageProxy``.
