  - The Dell Storage Center driver is moved to the dell_emc directory
    and has been rebranded to its current Dell EMC SC name. The
    volume_driver entry in cinder.conf needs to be changed to
    ``cinder.volume.drivers.dell_emc.sc.storagecenter_fc.SCFCDriver``
    for FC or
    ``cinder.volume.drivers.dell_emc.sc.storagecenter_iscsi.SCISCSIDriver``
    for ISCSI.
