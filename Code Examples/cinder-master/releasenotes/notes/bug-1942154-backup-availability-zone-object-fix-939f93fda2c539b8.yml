    Backup `Bug #1942154 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1942154>`_:
    Fixed backup.availability_zone to be populated with availability zone of
    the service that is creating the backup, if it was not provided as argument
    when creating the backup. This indirectly fixes selecting the proper host
    when restoring the backup as the availability zone field is now populated.
