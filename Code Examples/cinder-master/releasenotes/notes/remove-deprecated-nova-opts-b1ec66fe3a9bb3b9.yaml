upgrade:
  - Removed the deprecated options for the Nova connection:>
    os_privileged_user{name, password, tenant, auth_url},
    nova_catalog_info, nova_catalog_admin_info,
    nova_endpoint_template, nova_endpoint_admin_template,
    nova_ca_certificates_file, nova_api_insecure.
    From Pike, using the [nova] section is preferred to
    configure compute connection for Guest Assisted Snapshost
    or the InstanceLocalityFilter.
