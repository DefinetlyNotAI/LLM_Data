    Added boolean conf option 'split_loggers' in [default] section of
    cinder.conf to `enable split logging`_ functionality. The default
    value of split_loggers option is set to False. Operator can set it's
    value to True to split HTTP content into subloggers to allow for
    fine-grained control of what is logged and how. This new config option
    'split_loggers' should be enabled only when keystoneauth log level is
    set to DEBUG in 'default_log_levels' config option.
