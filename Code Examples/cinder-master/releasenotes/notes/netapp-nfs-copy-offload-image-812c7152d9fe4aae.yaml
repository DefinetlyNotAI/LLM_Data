    NetApp NFS driver: add an alternative approach to perform the efficient clone
    image when the Glance source store and Cinder destination pool are not in the
    same FlexVol, but they are in the same Cluster. Previously, the driver required
    the copy offload tool for doing it efficiently, which is no longer available.
    Now, the operators can maintain their efficient clone image by relying on the
    storage file copy operation.
