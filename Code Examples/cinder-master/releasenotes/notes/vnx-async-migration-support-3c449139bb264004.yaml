features:
  - VNX cinder driver now supports async migration during volume cloning.
    By default, the cloned volume will be available after the migration starts
    in the VNX instead of waiting for the completion of migration. This greatly
    accelerates the cloning process.
    If user wants to disable this, he could add
    ``--metadata async_migrate=False`` when creating volume from source
    volume/snapshot.
