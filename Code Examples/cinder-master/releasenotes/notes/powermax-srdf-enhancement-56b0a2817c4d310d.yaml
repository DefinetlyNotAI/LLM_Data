    PowerMax Driver - Two new replication specific configuration options
    sync_interval and sync_retries have been added to PowerMax cinder
    configuration.  These configuration options determine how many times to
    retry checks to see if a SnapVX copy mode has completed with a replication
    enabled volume, and how long to wait between retries.
