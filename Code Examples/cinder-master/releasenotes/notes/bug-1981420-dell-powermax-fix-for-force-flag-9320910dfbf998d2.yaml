    `Dell PowerMax Driver Bug #1981420 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1981420>`_:
    Fixed issue faced while creating synchronous volume which was caused by
    incorrect handling of the force flag. This is corrected by checking volume
    type extra specs for the value of "force_vol_edit"  parameter along with the
    "force" parameter.
