features:
  - Added policies to disallow multiattach operations.  This includes two
    policies, the first being a general policy to allow the creation or
    retyping of multiattach volumes is a volume create policy with the name
    ``volume:multiattach``.

    The second policy is specifically for disallowing the ability to create
    multiple attachments on a volume that is marked as bootable, and is an
    attachment policy with the name ``volume:multiattach_bootable_volume``.

    The default for these new policies is ``rule:admin_or_owner``; be aware
    that if you wish to disable either of these policies for your users you
    will need to modify the default policy settings.
