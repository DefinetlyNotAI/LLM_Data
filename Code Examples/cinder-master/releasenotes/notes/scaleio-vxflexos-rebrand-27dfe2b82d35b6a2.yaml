    Dell EMC ScaleIO has been rebranded to VxFlex OS. The drivers
    ``cinder.volume.drivers.dell_emc.scaleio.driver.ScaleIODriver``
    will now be updated to
    ``cinder.volume.drivers.dell_emc.vxflexos.driver.VxFlexOSDriver``
    in cinder.conf. Driver configuration options that start with ``sio``
    should also be updated to ``vxflexos``. Existing sio configuration options
    will continue to work but will be removed in the V release.
    Online documentation will also change to reflect these changes.
