deprecations:
  - |
    Use of JSON formatted policy files was deprecated by the ``oslo.policy``
    library during the Victoria development cycle. As a result, this
    deprecation is being noted in the Wallaby cycle with an anticipated future
    removal of JSON formatted file support by ``oslo.policy``. As such
    operators will need to convert to YAML policy files.
    Use the `oslopolicy-convert-json-to-yaml
    <https://docs.openstack.org/oslo.policy/latest/cli/oslopolicy-convert-json-to-yaml.html>`_
    tool to convert the existing JSON formatted policy file to YAML in a backward
    compatible way.
