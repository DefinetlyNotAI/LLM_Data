    Fujitsu ETERNUS DX driver: Add fragment capacity information of RAID Group.

    ETERNUS DX driver have two types of storage pools: RAID Group and
    ThinProvisioning Pool. Volumes can not be created in RAID Groups for
    the following situations:

    * The maximum sequential physical free space is smaller than the volumes to
      be created.

    * 128 volumes have already been created in the RAID Group.

    For the above reasons, to monitor the maximum sequential physical free
    space and total volumes in the RAID Group, when updating pool information
    using ``Get Volume Stats``, also update parameter ``total_volumes``
    (volumes already created in the RAID Group) and introduce
    ``fragment_capacity_mb`` (maximum sequential physical capacity) to the
    backend pool information if the backend pool is a RAID Group.

    Meanwhile, since creating volumes on ThinProvisioning Pool does not
    encounter the above restrictions, parameter ``fragment_capacity_mb`` will
    not be added into the information, and remove the ``total_volumes``
    parameter from the backend pool information when the type of backend pool
    is ThinProvisioning Pool.

    These two parameters can be utilized in future implementations of functions
    related to ``filter_function``.

    This patch also enabled the ``multiattach`` in the driver information.
