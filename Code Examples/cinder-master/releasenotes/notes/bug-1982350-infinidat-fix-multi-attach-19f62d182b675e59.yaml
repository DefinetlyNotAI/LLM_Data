    Infinidat Driver `bug #1982350
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1982350>`_:
    Fixed Infinidat driver multi-attach feature.
    Added a check if there are multiple attachments to the volume
    from the same connector and terminate connection only for the
    last attachment from the corresponding host.
