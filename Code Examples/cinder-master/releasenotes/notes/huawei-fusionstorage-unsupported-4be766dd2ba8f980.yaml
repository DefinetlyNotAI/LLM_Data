deprecations:
  - |
    The Huawei Fusionstorage driver has been marked as unsupported
    due to a lack of Python3.7 support and is now deprecated.
    ``enable_unsupported_driver`` will need to be set to ``True``
    in the driver's section in cinder.conf to continue to use them.
    If Python3.7 support is not demonstrated, the driver will be
    removed in the 'U' development cycle.
