  - HTTP connector for the Cinder Brocade FC Zone plugin.
    This connector allows for communication
    between the Brocade FC zone plugin and the switch
    to be over HTTP or HTTPs.  To make use of this
    connector, the user would add a configuration
    setting in the fabric block for a Brocade switch
    with the name as 'fc_southbound_protocol' with
    a value as 'HTTP' or 'HTTPS'.
