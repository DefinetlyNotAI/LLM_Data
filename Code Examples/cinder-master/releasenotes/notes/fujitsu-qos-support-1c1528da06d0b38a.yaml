    Fujitsu ETERNUS DX driver: Added support for QoS

    What QoS settings are available depends upon the storage firmware version
    of the ETERNUS AF/DX.

    * When the storage firmware version is less than V11L30-0000,
      only the upper limit of bandwidth(BWS) can be set using:

      - ``maxBWS``

      Note that when the firmware version of the ETERNUS AF/DX is earlier
      than V11L30, upper limits for the volume QoS settings of
      the ETERNUS AF/DX are set using predefined options.  This means that
      you should set the upper limit *of the ETERNUS AF/DX side* to a maximum
      value that does not exceed the specified ``maxBWS``.

    * When the storage firmware version is greater than V11L30-0000,
      the IOPS/Throughput of Total/Read/Write for the volume can be set
      separately using:

      - ``read_bytes_sec``
      - ``write_bytes_sec``
      - ``total_bytes_sec``
      - ``read_iops_sec``
      - ``write_iops_sec``
      - ``total_iops_sec``

      See the `Fujitsu ETERNUS DX driver documentation
      <https://docs.openstack.org/cinder/latest/configuration/block-storage/drivers/fujitsu-eternus-dx-driver.html>`_
      for details.
