    NetApp ONTAP driver: Added support for QoS Min (floor) throughput specs.
    The driver now accepts ``minIOPS`` and ``minIOPSperGiB`` specs, which can
    be set either individually or along with Max (ceiling) throughput specs.
    The feature requires storage ONTAP All Flash FAS (AFF) with version equal
    or greater than 9.3 for NFS and 9.2 for iSCSI and FCP. It also works with
    Select Premium with SSD and C190 storages with at least ONTAP 9.6.

    NetApp ONTAP driver: Added a new driver specific capability called
    `netapp_qos_min_support`. It is used to filter the pools that has support
    to the Qos minimum (floor) specs during the scheduler phase.
