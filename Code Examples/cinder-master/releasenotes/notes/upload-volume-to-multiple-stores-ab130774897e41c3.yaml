    This release includes support for Glance automatic image colocation.
    When a volume originally created from an image is uploaded to the
    Image service, Cinder passes Glance a reference to the original
    image.  Glance may use this information to colocate the new image data
    in the same image store(s) as the original image data.  Consult the
    Glance documentation for more information.
