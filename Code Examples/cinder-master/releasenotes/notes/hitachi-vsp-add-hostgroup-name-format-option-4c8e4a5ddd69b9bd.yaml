    Hitachi driver:  Add a config option ``hitachi_group_name_format`` for
    hostgroup name format.

    When using this option, users can specify the name format of
    host groups or iSCSI targets.
    Rules of the format:

    * Usable characters are alphanumerics, ".", "@", "_", ":", "-",
      "{" and "}". "{" and "}" can be used only in variables.
    * The specified value must start with ``HBSD-``.
    * You can use the following variables:

      ``{wwn}``
        `FC driver only.`  This is replaced with the smallest
        WWPN of the WWPNs of the connecting node.
      ``{ip}``
        `iSCSI driver only.`  This is replaced with the IP address of
        the connecting node.
      ``{host}``
        This is replaced with the host name of the connecting node.

    * You can use each variable in the specified value no more than once.
    * The specified value must include the following variables:

      * FC driver: ``{wwn}``
      * iSCSI driver: ``{ip}``

    * The maximum length of a specified value is as follows:

      * FC driver: 64
      * iSCSI driver: 32

    * In the length calculation, use the following values as the length of
      each variable:

      * ``{wwn}``: 16
      * ``{ip}``: 15
      * ``{host}``: 1

    * If the specified value includes ``{host}``, the following rules apply:

      * characters that are not permitted for this parameter, they are
        replaced with ``_``.
      * If the length of the name after variable replacement exceeds
        the maximum length of host group (iSCSI target) names, the
        host name is truncated so that the length of the host groups or
        iSCSI targets do not exceed the maximum length.

    If you specify this parameter, it is recommended that you specify ``True``
    for the ``hitachi_group_create`` parameter to collect necessary
    information automatically.

    Examples:

    * FC driver: ``HBSD-{host}-{wwn}``
    * iSCSI driver: ``HBSD-{host}-{ip}``
