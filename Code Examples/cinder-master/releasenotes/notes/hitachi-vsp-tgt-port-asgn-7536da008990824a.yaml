    Hitachi driver: Add target port assignment. Defining particular
    ports in extra spec ``hbsd:target_ports`` determines which of
    the ports specified by the ``hitachi_target_ports`` or the
    ``hitachi_compute_target_ports`` parameters are used to create LUN
    paths during volume attach operations for each volume type.
