    Storwize SVC Driver: Fixes `bug 1749687
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1749687>`__
    previously lsvdisk() was called separately for every
    'in-use' volume in order to check if the volume exists
    on the storage.
    In order to avoid problem of too long driver initialization
    now lsvdisk() is called once per pool.
