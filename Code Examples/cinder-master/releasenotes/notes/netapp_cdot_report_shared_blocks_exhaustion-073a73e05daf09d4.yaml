features:
  - The NetApp cDOT drivers report to the scheduler,
    for each FlexVol pool, the fraction of the shared
    block limit that has been consumed by dedupe and
    cloning operations. This value, netapp_dedupe_used_percent,
    may be used in the filter & goodness functions for better
    placement of new Cinder volumes.
