upgrade:
  - |
    The old deprecated ``keymgr`` options have been removed.
    Configuration options using the ``[keymgr]`` group will not be
    applied anymore. Use the ``[key_manager]`` group from Castellan instead.
    The Castellan ``backend`` options should also be used instead of
    ``api_class``, as most
    of the options that lived in Cinder have migrated to Castellan.

    - Instead of ``api_class`` option
      ``cinder.keymgr.barbican.BarbicanKeyManager``, use ``backend`` option
      `barbican``
    - ``cinder.keymgr.conf_key_mgr.ConfKeyManager`` still remains, but
      the ``fixed_key`` configuration options should be moved to the ``[key_manager]`` section
