fixes:
  - When backing up a volume from a snapshot, the volume status would be set
    to "backing-up", preventing operations on the volume until the backup is
    complete. This status is now set on the snapshot instead, making the
    volume available for other operations.
upgrade:
  - The "backing-up" status is added to snapshot's status matrix.
