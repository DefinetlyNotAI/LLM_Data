    Welcome to the Victoria release of the OpenStack Block Storage service
    (cinder).  With this release, the Block Storage API version 3 has reached
    microversion **3.62**.  The cinder team would like to bring the following
    points to your attention.  Details may be found below.

    * Microversion 3.61 adds the ``cluster_name`` attribute to the volume
      detail response when called in an administrative context.

    * Microversion 3.62 adds API calls to manage the default volume type
      for a specific project.  See the `Default volume types (default-types)
      <https://docs.openstack.org/api-ref/block-storage/v3/#default-volume-types-default-types>`_
      section of the
      `Block Storage API v3 Reference
      <https://docs.openstack.org/api-ref/block-storage/v3/>`_
      for more information.

    * The handling of the default volume type for a cinder installation
      has been improved in this release.

    * The cinder backup service has added support for the popular Zstandard
      compression algorithm.  (The default is the venerable Deflate (zlib)
      algorithm.)

    * Many backend storage drivers have added features and fixed bugs.
