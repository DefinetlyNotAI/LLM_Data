fixes:
  - Fix for Tintri image direct clone feature. Fix for the bug 1400966 prevents
    user from specifying image "nfs share location" as location value for an
    image. Now, in order to use Tintri image direct clone, user can specify
    "provider_location" in image metadata to specify image nfs share location.
    NFS share which hosts images should be specified in a file using
    tintri_image_shares_config config option.
