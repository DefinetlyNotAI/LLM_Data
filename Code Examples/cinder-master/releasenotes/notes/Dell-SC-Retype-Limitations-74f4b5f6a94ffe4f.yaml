issues:
  - With the Dell SC Cinder Driver if a volume is retyped
    to a new storage profile all volumes created via
    snapshots from this volume will also change to the
    new storage profile.
  - With the Dell SC Cinder Driver retyping from one
    replication type to another type (ex. regular
    replication to live volume replication) is not
    supported.
fixes:
  - With the Dell SC Cinder Driver retyping to or from a
    replicated type should now work.
  - With the Dell SC Cinder Driver retype failed to
    return a tuple if it had to return an update to the
    volume state.
