    Added schema validation support using jsonschema `[json-schema-validation]`_
    for all supported v3 APIs.

    Following APIs were accepting boolean parameters with leading and trailing
    white spaces (for e.g. " true "). But now with schema validation support,
    all these boolean parameters henceforth will not accept leading and trailing
    whitespaces to maintain consistency.

    * Generic volume groups:

      * delete group: "POST /v3/{project_id}/groups/{group_id}/action"

      * failover replication: "POST /v3/{project_id}/groups/{group_id}/action"
    * Volume Snapshots:

      * create a snapshot: "POST /v3/{project_id}/snapshots"
    * Volume_actions:

      * set bootable: "POST /v3/{project_id}/volumes/{volume_id}/action"

      * volume readonly update: "POST /v3/{project_id}/volumes/{volume_id}/action"
