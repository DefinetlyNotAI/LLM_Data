    `Bug #1879578 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1879578>`_:
    A regression in the Train release caused Cinder to assign the default
    volume type too aggressively when a volume type was not specified in
    a volume-create request.  As a result, some alternative methods of
    specifying the volume type were ignored and the default type (either
    configured by the operator or the system default) would be assigned.

    This release restores the intended behavior, which is described as
    follows:

    If a ``volume_type`` is not specified when a volume is created, Cinder
    tries to infer the volume type from other information in the
    volume-create request:

    * if a ``source_volid`` is supplied in the request, the volume type
      is inferred from the source volume's volume type
    * if a ``snapshot_id`` is supplied in the request, the volume type
      is inferred from the volume type associated with the snapshot
    * if an ``imageRef`` is supplied in the request, and the image has
      a ``cinder_img_volume_type`` image property, the volume type is
      inferred from the value of that image property

    Otherwise, the volume type is the default volume type configured by
    the operator, and if no volume type is so configured, the volume type
    is the system default volume type, namely, ``__DEFAULT__``.

    When a volume type is specified explicitly in a volume-create call, Cinder
    will use the specified type.  If the specified type cannot be assigned due
    to a conflict with other parameters in the volume-create call, however, the
    call will result in a 400 (Bad Request) response.
