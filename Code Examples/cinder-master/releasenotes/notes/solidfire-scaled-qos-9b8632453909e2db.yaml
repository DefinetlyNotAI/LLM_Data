features:
  - The SolidFire driver will recognize 4 new QoS spec keys
    to allow an administrator to specify QoS settings which
    are scaled by the size of the volume. 'ScaledIOPS' is a
    flag which will tell the driver to look for 'scaleMin',
    'scaleMax' and 'scaleBurst' which provide the scaling
    factor from the minimum values specified by the previous
    QoS keys ('minIOPS', 'maxIOPS', 'burstIOPS'). The
    administrator must take care to assure that no matter what
    the final calculated QoS values follow minIOPS <= maxIOPS
    <= burstIOPS. A exception will be thrown if not. The QoS
    settings are also checked against the cluster min and max
    allowed and truncated at the min or max if they exceed.
fixes:
  - For SolidFire, QoS specs are now checked to make sure
    they fall within the min and max constraints. If not
    the QoS specs are capped at the min or max (i.e. if
    spec says 50 and minimum supported is 100, the driver
    will set it to 100).
