    The Swift backup driver now supports sending a X-Service-Token header with
    a service token when the new ``backup_swift_service_auth`` config option is
    enabled. Please note that you still need to configure the ``[service_user]``
    group and also set ``send_service_user_token`` to enable the behavior and not
    only the Swift backup driver option. Note ``send_service_user_token`` enables
    it globally and will also affect communication with Nova and Glance.
