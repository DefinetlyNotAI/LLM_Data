    Infinidat Driver `bug #1981982
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1981982>`_:
    Fixed Infinidat driver to use TLS/SSL communication between the Cinder
    volume service and the storage backend. Admin can set `True` or `False`
    for the `driver_use_ssl` and `suppress_requests_ssl_warnings` options in
    the driver section of cinder.conf to enable or disable these features.
