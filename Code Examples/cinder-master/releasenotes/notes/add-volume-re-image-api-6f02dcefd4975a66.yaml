    Add microversion 3.68 to support the ability to re-image a volume with a
    specific image. Specify the ``os-reimage`` action in the request body.

    A volume in ``available`` or ``error`` status can be re-imaged directly.
    To re-image a volume in ``reserved`` status, you must include the
    ``reimage_reserved`` parameter set to ``true``. When reimaging a volume,
    the volume state will be changed to ``downloading`` first.

    Note that this is a destructive action, that is, all data currently
    contained in a volume is destroyed when the volume is re-imaged.

    Two new policies are introduced to govern this functionality:

    * ``volume:reimage`` - users who satisfy this policy may re-image a volume
      in status ``available`` or ``error``
    * ``volume:reimage_reserved`` - users who satisfy this policy may re-image
      a volume in status ``reserved``

    The default setting for both policies allow an administrator or the volume
    owner to perform the associated action.  See the `Policy configuration
    <https://docs.openstack.org/cinder/yoga/configuration/block-storage/policy.html>`_
    documentation in the `Cinder Service Configuration` guide for details.
