    The Cinder Volume Backup service can now be run on Windows. It supports
    backing up volumes exposed by SMBFS/iSCSI Windows Cinder Volume backends,
    as well as any other Cinder backend that's accessible on Windows (e.g.
    SANs exposing volumes via iSCSI/FC).

    The Swift and Posix backup drivers are known to be working on Windows.
