    Hitachi driver: Add a feature ``Port Scheduler``. This feature is enabled
    when specifying ``True`` for the parameter ``hitachi_port_scheduler``.
    When this feature is enabled and an attach request is received, the active
    WWNs that are obtained by Fibre Channel Zone Manager will be distributed
    and registered to the host groups of each port of the storage system.
    To use this feature, specify ``True`` for both parameters
    ``hitachi_group_request`` and ``hitachi_rest_name_only_discovery``.
    If you specify ``False`` or use default value for the
    ``hitachi_rest_name_only_discovery``, it will take a long time to attach
    volume, by seeking the host group for all specified ports.
    This feature is supported on Fibre Channel only.
