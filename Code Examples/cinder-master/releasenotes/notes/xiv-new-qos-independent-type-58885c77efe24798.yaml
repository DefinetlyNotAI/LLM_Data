features:
  - Added independent and shared types for qos classes in XIV & A9000.
    Shared type enables to share bandwidth and IO rates between volumes
    of the same class. Independent type gives each volume the same
    bandwidth and IO rates without being affected by other volumes in
    the same qos class.
