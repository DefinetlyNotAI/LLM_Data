features:
  - Cinder now allows for capacity based QoS which can be useful in
    environments where storage performance scales with consumption (such as
    RBD backed storage).  The newly added QoS specs are `read_iops_sec_per_gb`,
    `write_iops_sec_per_gb`, `total_iops_sec_per_gb`, `read_bytes_sec_per_gb`,
    `write_bytes_sec_per_gb` and `total_bytes_sec_per_gb`.  These values will
    be multiplied by the size of the volume and passed to the consumer.

    For example, setting `total_iops_sec_per_gb` to 30 and setting
    `total_bytes_sec_per_gb` to `1048576` (1MB) then creating a 100 GB volume
    with that QoS will result in a volume with 3,000 total IOPs and 100MB/s
    throughput limit.
