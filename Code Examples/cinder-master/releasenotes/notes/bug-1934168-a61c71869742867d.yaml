    The optional driver feature "Snapshot Attachment" has been removed
    from the `Cinder Driver Support Matrix
    <https://docs.openstack.org/cinder/latest/reference/support-matrix.html>`_.
    It is an enhancment used for backups, it is not exposed via the
    Block Storage API, and its presence in the Support Matrix was
    misleading.
