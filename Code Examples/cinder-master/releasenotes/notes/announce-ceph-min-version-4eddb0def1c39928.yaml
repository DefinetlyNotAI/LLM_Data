    RBD driver: Prior to this release, the Cinder project did not have a
    statement concerning what versions of Ceph are supported by Cinder.
    We hereby announce that:

    * For a given OpenStack release, Cinder supports the current Ceph
      active stable releases plus the two prior releases.
    * For any OpenStack release, it is expected that the versions of
      the Ceph client and server are in alignment.

    The `Ceph RADOS Block Device (RBD)
    <https://docs.openstack.org/cinder/latest/configuration/block-storage/drivers/ceph-rbd-volume-driver.html>`__
    driver documentation has been updated to reflect
    this policy and explains it in more detail.
