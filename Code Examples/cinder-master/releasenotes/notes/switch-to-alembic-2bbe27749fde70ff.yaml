    The database migration engine has changed from `sqlalchemy-migrate`__ to
    `alembic`__. For most deployments, this should have minimal to no impact
    and the switch should be mostly transparent. The main user-facing impact is
    the change in schema versioning. While sqlalchemy-migrate used a linear,
    integer-based versioning scheme, which required placeholder migrations to
    allow for potential migration backports, alembic uses a distributed version
    control-like schema where a migration's ancestor is encoded in the file and
    branches are possible. The alembic migration files therefore use a
    arbitrary UUID-like naming scheme and the ``cinder-manage db sync`` command
    now expects such an version when manually specifying the version that should
    be applied. For example::

        $ cinder-manage db sync 921e1a36b076

    It is no longer possible to specify an sqlalchemy-migrate-based version.
    When the ``cinder-manage db sync`` command is run, all remaining
    sqlalchemy-migrate-based migrations will be automatically applied.
    Attempting to specify an sqlalchemy-migrate-based version will result in an
    error.
