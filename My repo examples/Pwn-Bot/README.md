## üìú Introduction

### ü™ü Overview

This project integrates an AutoPcap plugin
with a Discord bot to automate the capture and analysis of `.pcap` files.
The AutoPcap plugin enhances Pwngotchi's capabilities
by automating the upload of captured packets to Discord via a webhook.
Simultaneously, the Discord bot facilitates interaction with Discord servers,
specifically managing messages related to pcap files. 
It extracts, decrypts, and analyzes these files, 
offering a streamlined workflow for cybersecurity enthusiasts.

### üìñ Purpose

The primary aim of this project is to simplify 
the process of capturing, uploading, and analyzing network traffic 
for educational and cybersecurity purposes.
By automating these tasks, users can focus more on analysis rather than manual processing.

## üì¶ Installation

### üìÑ Prerequisites

#### üß† For Pwngotchi

- Ensure Pwngotchi is correctly set up and operational without any plugins initially.
- Familiarity with Pwngotchi's operation and configuration.

#### ü§ñ For Discord Bot

- Python 3.x installed.
- Access to the Discord Developer Portal.
- Basic knowledge of Discord bot development.
- A Linux environment for running the bot's code due to specific requirements in the cracking function.
  - Kali Linux is recommended for ease of use and availability of necessary tools.
  - Required Linux Packages: `airmon-ng`, `tshark`, `editcap`, `pcapfix`.

### ü™ú Steps to Install

#### üõú Pwngotchi Side

1. Clone the repository or download the plugin script.
2. Place the `AutoPCAP.py` script in the `/usr/local/share/pwngotchi/custom-plugins/` directory on your SD card.
3. Modify your Pwngotchi configuration file (`/etc/pwngotchi/config.toml`) to enable custom plugins by adding or updating the line:
   ```toml
   main.custom_plugins = "/usr/local/share/pwngotchi/custom-plugins/"
   ```

#### ü§ñ Discord Bot Side

1. Clone the repository or download the Discord bot script.
2. Place the `Bot.py` script in a suitable location on your computer/SD card.
3. Configure the script to start automatically on boot with sudo permissions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

### üõú Pwngotchi Configuration

Create a `config.json` file in the plugin's directory with the following structure:
```json
{
  "webhookUrl": "YOUR_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL_HERE"
}
```
Replace `"YOUR_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL_HERE"` with your actual Discord webhook URL.

### ü§ñ Discord Bot Configuration

Discord Bot Creation
1. Visit the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
2. Create a new application and add a bot to it.
3. Make sure the bot has these permissions when creating it:
   - View Channels
   - Read Message History
   - Send Messages
   - Manage Messages (for clearing reactions)
   - Add Reactions
   - Attach Files
   - Create Invites
4. Make sure all the intents in the `intents` section are enabled, these are found in the `oauth2` section.
5. Make sure the bot is added to the server you want to interact with.
6. Navigate to the bot page and copy the bot token. This token will be used later.

Account Activation
1. Activate your Discord account for developer mode to access channel IDs.
2. Go to your account's settings and navigate to the "Advanced" tab.
3. Enable "Developer Mode" and click "Save Changes".
4. Go to your 2 channels in your server and copy the channel IDs of a channel where pcap files should be sent (by the webhook, for security reasons make it a public restricted channel where only mods can talk in it) and a channel where logs should be sent (For privacy reasons, this should be a private channel).

Configuration
1. Update the `api.json` file with your bot's token, channel IDs, and other necessary configurations as per the instructions below.
2. Replace placeholders in the code with actual usernames and passwords as needed. Ensure to follow the format specified in the comments.
3. The bot's behavior and settings are configurable through the `api.json` file located in the project directory. Here's what you need to know:
   - **Token**: Your bot's token obtained from the Discord Developer Portal.
   - **Channel IDs**: Two channel IDs are required:
     - `channel_id_(for_pcaps)`: The ID of the channel where pcap files should be sent.
     - `channel_id_(for_logs)`: The ID of the channel where logs should be sent.
   - **Webhooks Username**: A list of usernames that the bot should respond to. Include `#0000` for webhook usernames.
   - **Log Using Debug**: A boolean value indicating whether to log using debug level, for production purposes set this to `false`.


Running the Bot
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install required Python packages from the `requirements.txt` file using pip.
3. Run the bot in a Linux environment with sudo privileges for cracking purposes.

## üö¶ Usage

### üõú Pwngotchi Usage

After installation and configuration, 
the AutoPcap plugin will automatically capture `.pcap` files and upload them to Discord
upon detecting handshakes. The plugin logs all activities, aiding in tracking progress and troubleshooting.

The plugin is able to upload `pcap` files only if connected to the internet. 
To do that follow this [guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5yb43PlhEA).

### ü§ñ Discord Bot Usage

Ensure the bot is running in a Linux environment with sudo privileges.
Users can interact with the bot by sending messages in the configured channels,
triggering responses based on message content and settings.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Bot Reaction Glossary

The bot will generate many types of reactions to respond to various messages that include the pcaps uploaded.
As part of its job, if an error occurs a reaction will be generated, 
and if a pcap has already been cracked, a different reaction will be generated.
Here they are:-

### ‚õî Reaction
The bot is not running in a linux environment.

### üëç Reaction
The bot successfully cracked and uploaded the pcap file.

### üëé Reaction
The bot failed to crack the pcap file.

### ‚ùî Reaction
An unknown return occurred in cracking process

### ‚ùå Reaction
An error with python occurred, cracking failed

### üö´ Reaction
An error occurred with discord, processing failed, usually relating to permissions, 
this is an exception for HTTP errors

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Reaction
An unknown exception was caught, an error that handles the discord bot, occurs if the error
is not related to HTTP errors

### ‚ÅâÔ∏è Reaction
The whole script failed without any handling, this is unexpected and shouldn't happen

### üëÄ Reaction
The bot is handling the pcap currently, will later give it a different reaction

## üêõ Troubleshooting and Support

### üõú Pwngotchi Side Troubleshooting
