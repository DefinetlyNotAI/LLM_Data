# Mini DLL De-compiler Automator



Just a simple python script that automates opening `dotPeek` from JetBrains



Super small mini project, dont heed of it too much

You use it as follows:

`python dll.py "FULL DLL PATH"`

It will open `dotPeek` from its default path and open the dll alongside it
